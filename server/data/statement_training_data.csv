environment_statement
"Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202  Institution: The University of Manchester Unit of Assessment: 11 (Computer Science and Informatics)  1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy  1.i) Research Structures  Computer Science (CS) is central to modern societal challenges, and UoA11 activity stretches across the University. Connections are facilitated by the institutional Digital Futures Platform, a network of over 1000 researchers across 30 disciplines. The Department of Computer Science is at the core, delivering the fundamental CS that underpins University capabilities: housing 54/58 Unit staff, with 4 in the Medical School. In the REF period, income per FTE increased 79%, and Unit staff published over 1200 peer-reviewed outputs; partnered with 46 UK universities, and 660 EU organisations (e.g. contributing leadership in the EC FET Flagship Human Brain Project) and received 14 competitive fellowships, including an RAEng 10-year Chair, a RS Wolfson Research Merit Award, and a UK Parliamentary Fellowship.  The Department is part of the wider School of Engineering — connecting us to a breadth of expertise from electronics to materials, and reflecting our commitment to CS as an engineering discipline. Faculty, School and Unit strategies work synergistically to support research and its impact, providing economies of scale and barrier-free interactions. We pursue 6 themes: Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Centred Computing, Theory & Foundations, Software & e-Infrastructure, and Future Computing — each with an assigned academic lead — with cross-theme support from a Director of Research, Impact Lead, Outputs Champion, and Director of Business Engagement. Each of our academics self-identifies as a member of (at least) one of 9 research groups, which comprise the expertise to pursue our themes: Advanced Processor Technologies, Autonomy & Verification, Formal Methods, Human Computer Systems, Imaging Science, Information Management, Machine Learning & Robotics, Nano-Engineering & Spintronics, and Natural Language Processing & Text Mining. The themes provide breadth, while groups provide depth, supporting subject-specific nurturing of talent.  To bridge disciplines, we support joint appointments (currently 11), channelling impact across boundaries. Data Science/A.l.. 4 staff (imaging science) are joint with the Medical School; and 4 joint with the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology. Future Computing. 3 staff based in CS, work in device nano-engineering (returned with UoA12).  1.ii) Research Strategy  In the REF2014 statement, our strateqy was to foster a “virtuous circle” of pioneering and outward-looking research, illustrated in the figure below.  Pioneering ideas, setting the agenda, and solving hard problems, within the discipline  challenges solutions  Outward-looking research, engaging in knowledge transfer, and tackling grand challenges, beyond the discipline  Page 1 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  The plan for the REF period named 5 actions, for which we now review outcomes:  eo promoting studentships within the virtuous circle: Of 245 current PGRs, 15% are co- supervised by other Units, facilitated by 4 interdisciplinary doctoral programmes (fuelling outward-looking research). The Unit spent GBPS5,500,000 (see 2.viii) to support 178 PGRs unrestricted in topic, fuelling either outward-looking or pioneering research  e encouraging models of collaborative research: We promoted a range of collaboration through pursuit of diverse funding: e.g. UKRI (104 projects overall including 4 programme grants), EU (52 projects); KTPs (12); and CASE/ICASE studentships (14).  e engaging with our industry club: Our Industry Club has 200+ organisations (double 2014). This provides PGR recruitment pathways, and new research (e.g. we initiated a 5-year BBC Data Science Partnership, raising challenges in ethics, data science, and psychology).  e supporting sabbaticals and extended visits: Our flexible processes (2.iv) mean we regularly achieve our target of 10% of academics on sabbatical: many industry or public sector, e.g. one impact case builds on a sabbatical at NASA.  e encouraging different forms of dissemination: Our research was profiled at high-profile events (e.g. BlueDot 2018-19), TV, media and local events (4.iv).  To ensure critical mass covering both directions around the circle, we invested to link our themes:  oe Data Science/A.l.: Following a worldwide talent search, Kaski took up a “President's Chair in A.l”, and a role as Research Director for the UoM Christabel Pankhurst Institute for Health Technologies. This is a prime example of the virtuous circle — Kaski, well-known for fundamental ML, now leads research in an institute with focus on applications.  e A.l/Human Computing/Theory & Foundations: We built cross-theme bridges by hiring Cangelosi in cognitive robotics, and Fisher/Dixon/Dennis in verification of robotic systems. This includes a RAEng 10-year Emerging Technologies Chair (Fisher), developing automated reasoning theory (pioneering) applied to responsible autonomous systems (outward-looking).  eo Theory & Foundations/Future Computing: Building links to the UoM Digital Trust & Security Initiative, we recruited to grow cyber-security: in pioneering theory (Lammich) and outward- looking applications in UAV firmware security (Cordeiro), and secure networks (Mustafa).  eo Future Computing/A.l.: 5 new academics including Petoumenos, using Deep Learning for compiler analysis (pioneering); and Rhodes, developing computational neuroscience models on our ground-breaking SpiNNaker machine (outward-looking).  ¢ Human Computing/Software & e-Infrastructures/Future Computing: “People-Data-Chips” was an integrative initiative in ubiquitous computing, hiring Kotselidis/Clinch/Freitas. Kotselidis is now 0.5FTE industry (3.v), and Freitas is 0.5FTE with the UoM Cancer Research institute, both closing the virtuous circle again.  These actions enabled significant outputs, where the virtuous circle is evident.  As examples of pioneering ideas within the discipline: In our A.l. theme, Kaski contributed a new Deep Learning paradigm for differential flows that learn stochastic differential equations. In Future Computing, Koch developed the first method to detect malicious FPGA configurations by directly investigating binaries — the security patches adopted by Amazon Web Services. In Theory & Foundations, Cordeiro developed the first algorithms to verify multi-threaded software using shared-memory synchronization, identifying previously unknown vulnerabilities in Intel firmware. Voronkov/Reger made major advances in first-order logic theorem proving, implemented in the award-winning Vampire theorem prover - established as the world’s most powerful (with CASC/SMT competition victories and industrial deployment) theorem prover for first-order logic — with implications for adjoining areas such as verification and program analysis.  Page 2 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  As examples of outward-looking research: In Future Computing, Rhodes/Furber demonstrated the world’s first real-time simulation of a cortical microcircuit with over 300 million synapses, utilising our million-core SpiNNaker neuromorphic machine. Bridging our Future Computing/Theory & Foundations themes, Korovin developed the world’s first implementation of a non-deterministic Turing Machine using DNA, confirmed with in-vitro molecular biology. In A.l., Cootes/Lindner transformed the challenge of shape model-matching in medical images — the methodologies were commercialised and form an impact case, focusing on bone fracture assessment. In Human Centred Computing, Jay developed ECG visualisations for diagnosis of life-threatening conditions by non-specialists: subsequently shortlisted for the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee’s STEM for Britain Awards.  What we learnt: The “virtuous circle” works well as a high-level strategy. However, a finer-grained approach is necessary to have continued meaningful influence on our environment. In the period, our strategy has evolved with time, maintaining the “circle”, but expanding its influence.  In the REF2021 period, our major policies/initiatives/actions can be summarised as following a set of guiding principles, which also form the basis for our future strategy. These articulate our vision for what it means to be a world-class environment, and are intentionally light-touch, and “people- focused”. These align with University priorities (e.g. parity of support/esteem between research discovery/application, see REF5a 2.iv). Throughout this document, we highlight (where not self- explanatory) how the Principles were implemented.  Principle 1: Critical Mass & Complementarity. Ensuring we have an appropriate spread of intellectual capital to solve hard CS problems, tackle interdisciplinary grand challenges, and grow future leaders for both. For example: our recruitment strategy (2.i) targets individuals to naturally interface with colleagues across the new UoM Engineering structure (REF5a).  Principle 2: Empowerment & Support. Ensuring our researchers feel trusted, with the weight of the University behind them, with the time/motivation to take our Unit in new directions. For example: our duties assignment process supports short-notice secondments; the approval process for PGR training funds (2.x) encourages autonomy (empowerment), whilst mentoring/training (2.iii) provides essential ECR support.  Principle 3: Ambition & Curiosity. Ensuring we tackle ambitious real-world and interdisciplinary challenges, targeting “quality over quantity”, whilst also valuing curiosity-driven research with no short-term application. For example: we have increased interdisciplinary PGR activity, and promoted the “quality-over-quantity’ agenda for all, with emphasis for ECRs as they launch careers.  Principle 4: Responsibility. Ensuring our environment fosters open research and reproducibility, and is committed to equality, diversity, and inclusion. We have (i) engaged in leadership of the open research agenda; (ii) monitored/maintained EDIA as a key element of hiring policy, taking affirmative action where necessary; and (iii) continued to promote open research to all staff.  The Next Five Years  The Principles form a framework for future strategy. In the current period, we have made strong progress, though we see further areas to address for each.  In Principle 1, we will continue to support our current investments: robotics and formal verification; data science for healthcare, and hardware/software security, whilst strengthening capabilities in the fundamentals of Al. via a new pan-University centre exploiting the appointment of Kaski. In Principle 2, we will increase ECR involvement in leadership roles, within/beyond the department. In Principle 3, we will exploit the new UoM Engineering structures, increasing engagement in cross- disciplinary challenges. In Principle 4, we will pro-actively seek to recruit individuals with “non- traditional” career paths, bringing a diversity of perspectives to the environment.  Page 3 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  1.iii) Fostering Impact  Our strategy is founded on collaboration (exemplars in Section 4) and the institutional infrastructure for business engagement (3.ii). We support, enable, and incentivise our researchers in as broad a range of impact as possible, letting the talent speak for itself — the following actions implement Strategy Principle 2 (Empowerment/Support) and 3 (Ambition).  Support: Shortening Pathways to Impact: The UoM company “/nnovation Factory” (IF) accelerates all IP opportunities: e.g. legal issues, and Click2Go, a web-platform for licensing software. The Manchester Enterprise Centre develops/supports entrepreneurship via events/courses. Outcomes: IF assisted in founding 3 Unit spinouts (ExGence, Eurimatics, Data Value Factory); and Click2Go deployed the BoneFinder software (see impact case).  Faculty Impact Officers and Business Engagement Teams: The Faculty retains 3 full- time Impact Officers whose duties include liaison between industry/academics at the point of exploitation. The Business Engagement team (3.ii, also REF5a 4.1), provides opportunities, via regular events and connections to major organisations.  Strong support for EPSRC IAAs/KTPs as a catalyst for long-term activity, supported by a dedicated Knowledge Exchange team (5FTE) at Faculty level. Outcome: We held 29 IAAs (GBP851,359) and 12 KTPs (100% success rate, total GBP2,610,767, e.g., cross- disciplinary KTP with Bott&Co. Solicitors).  Enablers: Fostering partnerships: We have long-term partnerships (e.g. ARM, BBC, BAE Systems, AstraZeneca, Pfizer), via one-to-one contacts, and our wider Industry Club activities (e.g. invitations to the PGR Symposium provides opportunities). For academics, this affords collaboration, and for PDRAs/PGRs, a pathway to impactful careers. Outcomes: In the period, 20% of visitors were industry-based, and our club grew from 50 to 200+ members.  Releasing time via workload adjustments: \We award 0.1FTE reduction for fostering a recognised potential REF impact case, and ad-hoc adjustments for any (non-REF) impact activity. Sabbaticals can be used for impact (2.iv). Outcomes: Embury took two semesters (2018-19) to build relations with ARM, returning with an ARM/RAEng Industrial Fellowship.  Providing people & bridging funding: The Faculty funds PDRA “Impact Fellowships” (currently 18, 6-24 months). UoM employs a baseline-funded team of Research Software Engineers (3.ii). Strategic funds are available from Unit or central sources, to bridge PDRAs on flagship projects between contracts. Outcomes: One Fellow supports a potential impact case on virtual reality for amputee rehabilitation. The Unit provided bridging funding for a REF2021 impact case (SpiNNaker), supporting the long-term ambition in the project.  Enabling PGRs to play a role: Impact and public engagement are part of PGR training (2.x), and PGR internships are encouraged. Outcomes: PGR Seaton (2015, supervisor Lujan) interned at Oracle, with results built into a product, Graal VM. PGRs also engaged via the IAA account, e.g. Del-Pinto worked at SNOMED International, implementing sub-ontology generation, with the outcome built into the company’s strategic roadmap.  Incentives: Impact is an explicit factor in promotions (2.ii), and recognition/reward structures (2.vi),  whilst a culture of supporting the parity of esteem for impact/fundamentals is embedded in all departmental communications.  Page 4 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  Future vitality is supported by growing our ability to influence industrially-relevant funding programmes (e.g. Goodacre is Challenge Director for UKRI’'s GBP75,000,000 /SCF “Digital Security by Design”); and attracting researchers with interests in impact, e.g. our staffing strategy (2.i) explicitly pursues part-time appointments. Future sustainability is supported by: (i) duty roles for impact, e.g. public engagement (Reger/Cordeiro, each 0.1FTE); and Impact Champion (Embury 0.15FTE). (ii) supporting staff contributions in all areas (REF-eligible or not, see 4.iii); (iii) leadership, e.g. Jay in the UKRI Software Sustainability Institute (1.vi).  Linking Strategies to Impact Cases:  - Biorelate: A programme of research on contextual text-mining (led by Nenadic) was commercialized by a PGR, aided by a GBP10,000 grant from the Manchester Enterprise centre, and Nenadic’s pre-existing partnership with Pfizer.  - SpiNNaker. Original funding (EPSRC) was bridged to the EU funding via GBP250,000 UoM internal impact funding, retaining key PDRAs as they constructed the million-core machine. A sabbatical (2016) for Furber gave time to build up demonstrators for the machine, and SpiNNaker workshops were entirely coordinated by PGRs/PDRAs.  - NASA spacecraft: Barringer (retired) was introduced to a problem in runtime verification of spacecraft command sequences while on sabbatical at NASA. Barringer/NASA co-created a solution, used in space missions that continue to date. Reger (then PGR, now Category-A) contributed the QEA formalism, significantly reducing computational complexity, making it more attractive for NASA.  - Facial Performance 
Capture: Taylor/Cootes led basic research in face image modelling, stimulated by applications in face recognition, tracking, and synthesis, with early-stage support from /F. PDRA Edwards and PGR Walker led commercialisation of the ideas in two companies: ImageMetrics (both) and Cubic Motion (Edwards), with major impact in films and computer games.  - Improving Healthcare & Animal Welfare: Cootes/Taylor led research stimulated by challenges in medical imaging, on fundamental work for statistical models of shape and appearance of anatomical structures. Its success led to spin-out company, iMorphics, supported by the IF.  1.iv) Supporting Interdisciplinary Research  The University supports the Unit via several “Interdisciplinary Institutes” and platforms: some physical, some virtual, all resourced with staff-time. The Digital Futures platform (led by Taylor) involves Unit members in multiple multi-disciplinary challenges. The Institute for Data Science & A. cuts across UoM, connecting e.g. Physics and CS, in a Turing A.l. Fellowship (Scaife, UoA9). The Thomas Ashton Institute interfaces with the UK Health & Safety Executive (Jay leads on Digitalisation of Work; Ananiadou leads A.l. in health/safety). The Christabel Pankhurst Institute (led by Taylor/Kaski) channels expertise in A.l. for healthcare technologies.  The University also enables high-profile partnerships relevant to the Unit: e.g. the GBP10,000,000 Smart-City CityVerve project interfaced with local government/SMEs, and a 5-year institutional BBC Data Science Partnership (led by the Unit) raises challenges in data science/ethics.  Within the Unit, our virtuous circle strategy requires that clusters of interdisciplinary expertise be sustained and recognised, implementing Principle 3 (Ambition/Curiosity) of our strategy.  Page 5 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  Sustaining inter-disciplinary expertise is enabled by: a recruitment policy (2.i) that supports bridging compatible disciplines; a staff development strategy (2.ii) that supports diverse career paths (2.v); a sabbaticals policy (2.iv) that supports a range of leave types; an infrastructure for fostering partnerships (2.v) to support ambitious new endeavours; a PGR funding model and 4 inter- disciplinary doctoral programmes (2.vii, 2.viii) that encourage interdisciplinarity; and our seminar culture — 60% of Departmental seminars (from 200+ in the period) were tagged as ’interdisciplinary’.  Recognising inter-disciplinary expertise is enabled by: our strategy (1.ii) based fundamentally on the “virtuous circle”; promotions (2.ii) that explicitly recognise interdisciplinarity and impact; reward/recognition structures for all staff/PDRAs/PGRs (2.ix, 3.vi) that value a range of contributions; an institutional Open Research Policy (1.v) stating freedom of choice for the publication outlet; and ensuring ECRs have sight of interdisciplinary role models (e.g. Cangelosi in robotics/psychology; Furber in chip design/neuroscience; Goble in biology/e-infrastructure; Taylor in medical imaging/machine learning).  Evidence of Success:  ¢ Funding: Awards from 8/9 UKRI councils, and collaborative grants with a// UoM faculties and major organisational units.  eo Outputs: We published in journals across 191 Scopus areas, and contributed to the REF2021 return of 7 other UoAs (see 4.i).  e PGRs: 10 Unit staff co-supervise 29 PGRs in other departments, e.g. Mathematics, Psychology. The reverse is also true: 36/245 PGRs in CS are co-supervised by e.g. Law, Physics. 8 staff co-supervise 10 PGRs beyond UoM, e.g. Edinburgh, ETH Zurich.  eo Leadership: Taylor leads the national UKRI-funded NewMind Technology for Mental Health Network (4.v), building a multidisciplinary UK community of over 450 academics, clinicians, patients, and industrialists. Nenadic founded the UK healthcare text-analytics network, Heal Tex, with 250+ members.  1.v) Our Open Research Environment  The institutional strategy (for details, see REF5a 2.v) is set by the Open Research Strategy Group and the Open Research Working Group (ORWG), co-founded/chaired by Jay. ORWG defines institutional policy, which states that (i) outputs will be as open as possible, as early as possible; (ii) researchers have freedom of choice for the publication outlet; and (iii) the University is committed to responsible metrics. The policy implements the F.A.LLR. principles, constructed by an international consortium where the Unit (Goble) was a contributor.  Open Access is an institutional commitment, with library staff supporting the procedures. Web- based systems enable depositing outputs, paying fees, and managing embargoes. Institutional spend on Gold OA for the Unit was GBP165,022. The UoM OpenAccess+ scheme uses a Media Team for press releases and professionally edited articles (e.g. The Conversation).  Our staff support and lead Open Research: Locally. Our MSc/PhD programmes have open research and reproducibility embedded in the curriculum. Nationally: We play key roles in the UK Software Sustainability Institute (co-founder: Goble, Research Director: Jay). Internationally: Harper founded the ACM Emerging Interest Group on Reproducibility, Goble is UK representative on the European G7 Open Science Working Group, and sits on the UK Open Research Data Task Force.  Page 6 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  1.vi) Ensuring Research Integrity  The Institution maintains a Code of Good Research Conduct, articulating our commitment to research integrity, mirrored by a Code of Practice for Investigating Concerns on the Conduct of Research — ensuring strict but fair investigatory procedures (REF5a 2.v). The overall approach is to raise awareness and monitor compliance.  Maintaining ethical standards.  Awareness: a 3-hour Research Integrity course (renewed every 3 years) is mandatory for PDRAs/academics, with PGR training (2.x) provided by the Unit. A quarterly University-wide Ethics e-Newsletter, and (in the Unit) a monthly staff newsletter highlights relevant events.  Compliance: Research Ethics Committees (REC) are in place across the Institution, reporting to the University REC (UREC). Departmental Leads (Vigo/Clinch 0.1FTE) act as gateway to procedures. There are five levels of approval, from departmental (low-risk PGR projects), to UREC (high risk, stafffPGR), to national regulations (including NHS REC). The Unit processed 184 applications (161 approved) 2014-20, at all levels, supported by a bespoke online ethics system.  Meeting legal obligations.  Awareness: Training (mandatory for all academics, renewed biennially) includes: Export control (2 hours), Information Security & Data Protection (1 hour), EDIA (3 hours). Data Management. All proposals are required to engage in Data Management Planning (supported by the Library) via dmponline.ac.uk.  Compliance: The Research Lifecycle Project (3.ii) includes enterprise-grade systems for confidential data, requiring the highest security. Data Sharing: The central legal team coordinates NDAs/data-sharing contracts — e.g. recent arrangements include AstraZeneca, Oracle. Employment Law: All staff involved in PGR admissions and any recruitment panels must take an Unconscious Bias training course.  Exemplars of Contributing to professional standards:  In programming languages, Pop sits on the OpenMP Language Standards Committee.  In robotics/ethical autonomous systems: Fisher is a member of the BSI's AMT/010/01 Ethics for Robots and Autonomous Systems standards committee. Work by Dennis/Fisher was cited in BS8611 (“Guide to the ethical design and application of robots and robotic systems”), the first published standard related to robot ethics.  In web-accessibility, Harper is a member of W3C WA! Coordination Group.  Jay led the Software Sustainability Institute on REF2021 software guidelines (4.v).  Page 7 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202  2. People  Staffing Strateqy and Staff Development  2.i) Staffing and Recruitment Strategy  We seek  researchers from a range of backgrounds, guided by 4 processes, each of which is derived  from one of the 4 research strategy principles.  - Develop/maintain critical mass (implements Principle 1: Critical Mass & Complementarity).  [@]  [@]  Actions: We recognise and build on clusters of expertise: establishing leadership, and ensuring a continuous flow of new talent through succession planning.  Outcomes: New leadership in cognitive robotics (Cangelosi), Machine Learning (Kaski), and computer architectures (Goodacre, 0.4FTE joint appointment with ARM). We ensured a flow of talent by hiring at least 2 ECR academics every year 2015-2020, covering all 6 of our themes). In total 20/58 staff are new in post (14 ECRs) since 2014. We maintained critical mass via succession planning within the Future Computing theme (hiring Rhodes), and in Theory & Foundations (hiring Fisher/Dennis/Dixon).  - Seeking input from staff (implements Principle 2: Empowerment & Support).  [@]  Actions: The HoD actively solicits input from all staff on our recruitment strategy. When investment is available, the Head of Department (HoD) polls all academic staff on what the ‘Next Big Thing’ will be, and for names of rising stars in their area. All are encouraged to take a role in shaping the Unit, contributing their expertise/experience.  Outcomes: Our People-Data-Chips initiative (1.ii), was suggested by an academic without a leadership role, and recruited 3 ECRs in ubiquitous computing (Kotselidis, Clinch, Freitas) who all secured external Pl funding within 2 years of appointment.  - Bridging compatible disciplines (implements Principle 3: Ambition & Curiosity).  [@]  [@]  Actions: We use strategic hires to bridge clusters and avoid ‘sole-traders’, through e.g. advertising complementary new posts simultaneously.  Outcomes: In 2017 we bridged cyber-security/formal methods by hiring Cordeiro and Lammich. In 2018 we hired Cangelosi in cognitive robotics, naturally interfacing with the new UoM Engineering structures. In 2020, activity in robotics and formal verification was bridged by hiring Fisher/Dixon/Dennis.  - Pursuing equity in applications (implements Principle 4: Responsibility).  [@]  Actions: All academic job postings are run through software to identify gender-biased language. All shortlisting uses a ‘second-look’ policy to ensure equitable reasons for inclusion/exclusion. All panels involve at least one female academic, and all undergo mandatory EDIA training. Part-time appointments are considered for all posts and explicitly pursued when appropriate (e.g. personal reasons, or to maintain industry roles). Outcomes: Our Category-A gender profile (at the census date) is 26% female, versus 22% nationally (source: 2019 HESA centre 121), and 30% of all in-period appointments were female. The breakdown by gender profile is below. At the census date, among all research and academic staff, 19% are BAME — compared to 14% in the UK working age population (source: BCS Diversity Report 2020).  FTE Headcount #male : #female  % female  Lecturer 13.3 14 9:5 36% Senior Lecturer 14.9 16 13:3 19% Reader 4.8 5 2:3 60% Prof 20.1 23 19: 4 17%  Total 53.1 58 43:15 26%  To ensure long-term critical mass (Principle 1) and provide career stability (Principle 4), we have no short-term Category-A contracts.  Page 8 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  2.ii) Staff Development  Our staff development strategy (see also PDRA-specific support in 2.iii) pursues three goals, that emerge from our guiding principles.  o to identify/support upward trajectories (P2: Empowerment): We recognise that our variously talented staff benefit from specific resources to continue their trajectory. This is enabled via regular appraisal, mentoring, and support to pursue fellowships (e.g. feedback rounds on drafts, and mock interviews).  o to actively consider ‘growth opportunities’ at critical career points (P3: Ambition): When career-defining opportunities arise, individuals benefit from specific encouragement/support breaking into leadership roles. This is enabled via interlinked senior staff meetings (e.g. Promotions Committee makes recommendations to Duties Allocation committee, which assigns leadership roles and in turn recommends sabbaticals to the Leave of Absence Committee (2.iv).  o to ensure diverse career paths are recognised (P4: Responsibility). Excellent people come from a wide range of backgrounds, and many have non-traditional career paths. Recognising this, recruitment and promotions policies acknowledge a range of contributions.  Further details on how the strategy is implemented:  Mentoring is mandatory for ECR academics, via trained staff balanced in gender/seniority. Many ECRSs benefit from early/mid-career mentors, who have empathy with their situation. The University “Manchester Gold” scheme provides cross-discipline mentoring , matching junior/senior staff (e.g. Cangelosi mentors a UoA12 PDRA). Appraisal/individual development needs are supported via line managers in annual Performance & Development Reviews, offered to all academics/PDRAs. Individual ambitions and training needs are discussed, and action plans agreed. This is iteratively refined, and reported back to the Probation Committee (for ECR academics) and to the HoD. Fellowship eligibility/deadlines are tracked (see support teams in 3.i), and cases actively solicited.  Probation lasts 3 years: specific tailored objectives are agreed during induction, discussed annually with managers, reviewed by the Department Promotions Committee. Expectations are set at Faculty- level, in 4 categories: (Research, Teaching, Knowledge Transfer, Service/Leadership), with precise wording, e.g. “Submission of at least one research proposal per year that achieves good reviews”.  Promotions are considered annually, assessing 4 areas: research, teaching, service/leadership, and knowledge transfer — where parity of esteem is emphasised. Expectations have unambiguous language and measurable outcomes. Two meetings consider cases and provide feedback; each applicant has an assigned “shepherd” from the committee, to develop their case. As some demographics tend to underestimate their chances, the committee actively solicits cases. Off- schedule one-off pay increments are possible under a separate “Rewarding Exceptional Achievement’ policy, for any academic/PDRA.  Training: The VITAE Researcher Development Framework maps directly to a portfolio of 38 courses (1-5 hours each) across 5 areas: Career Management, Research & Enterprise, Communication, Leadership & Management, Teaching & Learning. UoM holds a European Commission HR Excellence in Research Award for the Concordat Implementation Plan, awarded in 2011, retained in 2020 after external review. The Inspiring Leaders programme provides 50 hours over 6 months for senior leadership. The Unit provides CS-specific training: e.g. role-playing mock EPSRC panel to clarify how funding decisions are made. Encouraging female leadership is a priority: four staff (Zhao, Jay, Clinch, Batista) were funded for leadership training (StellarHE, AdvanceHE Aurora).  Page 9 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  2.iii) Support for Early Career Researchers  The Unit develops ECRs (PGRs, PDRAs, and new academics) through: (i) training that provides a foundation for a diversity of careers; and (ii) the provision of time/resources that launch independent research careers — implementing Principle 2 (Empowerment/Support). The Institution assists with full implementation of the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers, which permeates our environment (REF5a 3.3.2).  Training: The institutional “New Academics Programme” comprises a mandatory 50 hours (HEA- accredited) over 18 months, also available to PDRAs (2.ii). For research, this includes e.g. grantsmanship, PGR recruitment. For knowledge transfer/impact: e.g. IP, and public engagement. In the Unit, a budget is available for national ECR events, e.g. CHERISH-DE “Digital Economy Crucible” (Batista/Clinch). PDRA support: ECR academic, Mustafa, holds a duty (0.1FTE) as “PDRA Champion”, fostering a PDRA culture of social/professional development. All PDRAs are informed of (and encouraged to participate in) the various opportunities in the Researcher Development programme.  Time/resources: To establish 
research, new academics “ramp-up” to full teaching/administrative duties: initially 40% of their FTE (whether full/part-time), increasing 20% annually. All new academics (regardless of FTE or contract) receive GBPS,000 unrestricted funds and a PhD studentship. An induction pack welcomes all academics/PDRAs, and an informal but professional culture is supported with frequent social events. A bi-monthly ECR Lunch is hosted by the HoD, on themes chosen by ECRs: e.g. supervision skills, and managing workload.  Evidence of success: In the period, we hired 14 new Category-A staff (Lindner, Olivier, Petoumenos, Lammich, Rhodes, Mustafa, Cordeiro, Freitas, Kotselidis, Battista, Mu, Clinch, Reger, Vigo) All of these obtained funding as PIl/Co-| within 2 years of appointment; 5 with competitive fellowships (Lindner, Batista, Pop, Mustafa, Petoumenos). Two hold major awards as Pl: Cordeiro, (EP/T026995/1, GBP1,721,559), Reger (EP/V000497/1, GBP1,034,989).  Many PDRAs grow careers within the Institution: 5 of our Category-A staff were PDRAs in REF2014 (Vigo, Kotselidis, Batista, Rhodes, Reger). Others choose industry: e.g. Ghasempour (PDRA 2012- 15, now Head of Machine Learning, The Hut Group); Sechidis (PDRA 2015-18, now Senior Scientist, Novartis); Haines (PDRA 2014, now institutional Head of Research IT, also UK Society for Research Software Engineering co-founder).  2.iv) Policies for Research/Impact/Sabbatical Leave  The policy: Academics are eligible for sabbaticals of 1 semester after 3 years’ service, or 1 full year after 6 years. These are unconstrained; on-site, cross-departmental, or international, and target outcomes are broad: e.g. industrial/social impact, grant preparation, or re-focus of research area. We allow ‘mini-sabbaticals’ from duties like tutorials/projects, to protect contiguous blocks of time. We encourage multi-year leave, e.g. two second semesters, enabling longer-term activity.  Procedure: Cases are solicited annually, including actively seeking applications, and taking recommendations from other senior committees. Cases are prepared with line manager support, and reviewed by the Leave of Absence Committee, with membership monitored for diversity.  Outcomes: 29 took major leave: 13 for a single semester, 16 for a full year, and 10 had ‘mini-  sabbaticals’. Nenadic took a 2015 sabbatical to shift focus to temporal text-analytics — enabling BBSRC grant (GBP730,460, BB/N019547/1) on modelling veterinary health records.  Page 10 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  2.v) Fostering Interfaces for Knowledge Exchange  Our impact strategy (1.iii) is further supported by fostering relationships, via 3 key activities which together implement Principles 1 (Critical Mass/Complementarity) and 3 (Ambition).  eo We pursue and maintain strategic partnerships: We engage with both top-down MoUs (e.g. ARM Centre of Excellence) and bottom-up (e.g. personal contacts at local SME, Peak.ai). Our Industry Club is a stepping-stone to deeper relationships — the 200+ members are invited to events (e.g. PGR Symposium) and informed of activity via quarterly newsletters.  o We recruit from diverse career paths, e.g. 4 academics had industrial careers of 5+ years (Cordeiro, Goodacre, Kotselidis, Rhodes) prior to Manchester, and 5 Category-A staff have joint industrial appointments (Voronkov, Paton, Goodacre, Kotselidis, Pavlidis). Secondments can be taken at short-notice, and duties adjusted — e.g. a short-notice part- time post at ARM Ltd (Brown), led to a patent and investment (GBP50,000) to the Unit.  eo We connect MScs and PGRs to the pipeline: The early stages of a relationship require small-scale interactions, which we achieve by engaging new researchers — in the period 64 industry-partnered MSc research projects, and 9 PGR internships, were arranged.  Further outcomes: We enjoyed major new collaborations with e.g. AstraZeneca, BBC R&D, Oracle (4.ii). We hosted 14 CASE/iICASEs (6 in REF2014). We supported the foundation of 3 spinouts by stafffPGRs (ExGence, Eurimatics, Data Value Factory), and growth of two others (Cogniscience, iMorphics), both of which aided our impact case portfolio.  2.vi) Recognising, Rewarding, and Supporting Research with Impact  Details of how we support the achievement of impact from research are in 1.iii, 3.v, and 4.ii. To recognise/reward successes, a variety of mechanisms are in place. Examples: /n Abstract is a Faculty-level web-archive of world-class papers, with press releases curated by Marketing & Communications, recognising success regardless of subject. Better World is an institutional ceremony for research with social impact, and Postdoc Appreciation Week has web- profiles/interviews with PDRAs, and funded social events. Personalised letters from the President recognise major successes (e.g. fellowships). In the Unit, the weekly newsletter names and celebrates all successes, from PGR prizes to Professorial Inaugurals.  Qur Postgraduate Researchers  2.vii) PGR Recruitment  The recruitment of diverse and excellent PGRs is central to our mission, enabled by initiatives which implement Principle 1 (Critical Mass and Complementarity) and 4 (Responsibility). These are (i) dedicating significant resources to recruitment; (ii) having a diversity of programmes (iii) pursuing a diversity of candidates; (iv) achieving the ‘right fit’ through meaningful engagement.  (i) Resources: Processes are unified across the Faculty, ensuring applicants can be recommended cross-departmentally. In the Unit, academic roles: PGR Director (0.2FTE), Deputy (0.1FTE), PGR Marketing lead (0.1FTE), are supported by administrative staff, and in-house software to distribute applications, collect feedback, and send out offers. The average time from application to decision is 4 weeks. At institutional level, Nenadic is Faculty PGR Committee Chair.  (ii) Diversity of PGR Programmes: We participate in 4 interdisciplinary doctoral training programmes: 4|IR-STFC CDT in Data-Intensive Science, ESRC Data Analytics & Society CDT, EPSRC Graphene NOWNANO CDT, and a psychology/robotics programme with the Italian Institute of Technology. A new EngD programme was established (2019), to support PGRs based primarily in industry, and we changed progression timings to support extended internships.  Page 11 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  (iii) Diversity of Candidates: We offer 50+ annual fee waivers for the China Scholarship Council; and UoM advertises 100 President's Doctoral Scholarships, the first annual round restricted to overseas applicants (10 in-programme). We “grow our own” via Manchester MSc/UG programmes aligning with research strengths; e.g. of 245 current PGRs, 9% came from our UG programme, and 28% hold a Manchester degree (UG/PGT, any discipline). EDIA: Disability Support is advertised widely, and we provide structural adaptations to the environment (2.xi).  (iv) Achieving the right ‘fit’: Virtual and physical PGR Open Days allow candidates to meet staff, and experience the environment before committing. Interviews for all admissions/funding, have a rotating panel of 5 academics (membership, and interviewees, monitored by PGR Director for equity in gender, ethnic origin, and research area). In the period, 15 PGRs have opted for part- time enrolment to suit personal circumstances (9 in-programme).  Outcomes: Our programmes have attracted applications from all over the world (34 countries; normally 70% overseas). In the period, 16 declared a disability, with 7 receiving explicit funded support (e.g. screen-readers and adapted office space).  2.viii) PGR Studentships  To enable a high-quality, diverse PGR cohort - following strategy Principle 4 (Responsibility) - we access a broad range of funding sources, and Departmental funds/fee waivers support PGRs without funding. Departmental funds support new academics’ start-up packages, strategically important proposals, and areas of research growth. In addition, UoM provides Dean’s Awards and President’s Doctoral Scholarships to outstanding candidates, competitive across the University.  We have taken active steps to grow our PGR activity as a driver for research vitality. At the census date the unit had 245 in-programme PGRs (a 91% increase, compared to 128 at the end of the previous period — see REF2014 5b). Of these 42 were UKRI-funded: 28 EPSRC CDT/DTP, 11 EPSRC iCASE (e.g. BAE, EDF), 3 EPSRC CASE; 22 were funded by competitive President's and Dean's awards, 62 by overseas governments, 7 split-site funded by the Italian Institute of Technology, and 44 self-funded. Furthermore, we have significantly increased departmental investment in PGRs, with an average spend of GBP836,000 p.a. on a combination of studentship fee-waivers and stipends, up from GBP500,000 in REF2014 — a 67% increase. This resulted in full/partial funding for 178 of our current cohort, up 254% from 70 in 2014.  2.ix) PGR Support and Progress Monitoring  PGR Support eo Supervisory teams: Every PGR has a main supervisor, one or more co-supervisors, and a  cohort advisor. Supervisors monitor technical progress; advisors provide pastoral support with weekly meetings in groups of 6, and on-demand one-on-one meetings.  eo Peer support: All spend their first 6 months in the ‘PGR Home’ area (custom-built 2017 GBP60,000); where cross-group cohorts support multi-disciplinarity. Senior PGRs participate in our PGR Mentors scheme, and representatives sit on Staff PGR committee.  * Recognising/rewarding success: The PGR Symposium is an annual highlight, with talks by 3rd-years, posters by 2nd-years, keynotes (2019: Simon Segars, ARM CEO), industry prizes (currently IBM Research), and two Professor's prizes for best paper/thesis.  eo Mental health: In 2018, Research England and the Office for Students awarded funds for UoM’s “Well Bee-ing” PGR Mental Health Project. Among the outcomes (implemented in UoM policy, recommended nationally by OfS) was to review length/structure of programmes, and to promote mindfulness in PGRs.  eo Extensive training (for details see 2.x)  Page 12 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  PGR progress monitoring ¢ An institutional electronic progression system tracks PGR milestones, records training needs, and sets expectations at quarterly intervals, with supervisor and PGR Director sign- off. The annual progression process requires the PGR to deliver a report and presentation on progress and plans, with interviews by two academics outside the area.  Evidence of Success:  A step-change in PGR pastoral care (2017, e.g. cohort advisors) helped first-year progression: 75% (2014) to 98% (2018) to 100% (2019).  At international conferences, our PGRs won 11 Best Paper prizes with the PGR as first author — e.g. D’Antras et al 2017 (PLDI Distinguished Paper), and Arrelanes et al 2018 (/CloT Best Paper), whilst a journal article resulting from a PhD thesis (Nikolaou, EPSRC CDT-funded) received an ACM Computing: Notable Article of 2016 commendation (Nikolaou et al, 2016).  In REF2, 35% of our outputs have a PGR as first author.  2.x) Details of PGR Training  Unit-level: All PGRs attend 4 full-semester courses on Scientific Methods (40 contact hours plus 130 offline), plus skills workshops (30 hours). Optional computing courses are available for cross- disciplinary PGRs. Attendance on MSc modules is encouraged to specialise knowledge. Faculty- level: All PGRs can take mini-courses across 49 topics: research (16), TA training (6), impact/engagement (12), career management (3), and wellbeing (12)..  Individual Training Funds: Every PGR has GBP3,000 to enhance training: e.g. conferences, regardless of publication — approval is light-touch, and via supervisor, group lead, or PGR Director. IT resources are separate, with machines replaced as needed. EDIA: Some PGRs were reluctant to request funds from their supervisor, so we heavily promoted the fund and alternative approval mechanisms (implementing P2: Empowerment).  We prepare PGRs for diverse careers. Industrial. 9 PGRs took internships, e.g. BBC, IBM. Outreach: 3 PGRs joined our Project Malawi programme; PGRs co-hosted 7 Nuffield Foundation placement pupils; 4 PGRs are STEM ambassadors. For academic careers, EPSRC Doctoral Prizes are a springboard (6 in-period) e.g. Nikolaou 2016, now senior RF, UCL Astrophysics.  2.xi) Equality and Diversity  Social Responsibility is one of three core goals of UoM, reflected in duty roles at Faculty, School, and Department level. Policies embedded throughout the Institution create the desired culture: for example, an appointments policy that implements a version of the Mansfield Rule. At Departmental level, strategy is coordinated by the EDIA committee (4 academics, 1 RF, 2 PGRs) meeting quarterly. For oversight/guidance, we follow charter schemes, e.g. Athena Swan Bronze award, renewed 2020 (for full list of schemes, see REF5a 3.2).  Commitment to EDIA in Career Pathways  Appointments: Adverts are vetted by a software gendered-text analyser. Part-time appointments are considered for all roles at advertisement-stage wherever possible. Internal research leadership roles are advertised to all and applicants are encouraged to have informal discussions with relevant senior staff. At all panels, a member of EDIA committee is required.  Page 13 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  Support for promotions: Our ‘shepherding’ scheme (2.ii) ensures writing support for all applicants, strengthened by explicit support for social anxieties (3.iv), and three rounds of drafts/reviews before submission.  Support for acquiring funding: Statistics are monitored by Faculty, and corrective actions taken as appropriate, e.g. soliciting fellowship applications from under-represented groups (also 3.iv).  Part-time staff: Several academics choose part-time employment (11/58 individuals, 0.3-0.8FTE), for maintaining industry roles, or personal reasons. Reduced FTE does not restrict progression—all committees (e.g. promotions) explicitly acknowledge individual circumstances, scaling expectations. In the period we promoted one individual (0.4FTE) to Professor (teaching-focused), one (0.8FTE) to Reader, and one (0.5FTE) to SL; and 8 academics/senior RFs reduced FTE for flexible retirement.  Fixed-term staff: The UoM Policy Contracts of Employment (revised 2017) provides protection for  fixed-term employees. At contract end a PDRA is placed on the Redeployment Register (enabling preferential consideration for internal posts).  Commitment to EDIA in Support of Staff/PGRs  The Leave of Absence Committee manages study leave via transparent processes. Membership ensures representation across ethnicity, gender, career-stage, and career track. We recognise many types of leave (2.iv). In the period, 29 took sabbaticals: 35% female, 14% BAME, 10% with disclosed long-term health issues.  Caring responsibilities are supported by a broad recognition of leave-types: maternity, paternity, shared, and adoption (3 staff took parental/adoption leave, and 2 reduced hours for child-care). Arrangements with local nurseries permit salary-sacrifice. A New Parents’ Room has a fridge and appropriate privacy. PGRs access Equal Mobility Grants (GBP500 per trip) for caring responsibility.  Long-term health issues are accommodated by workload adjustments (e.g. one individual was removed from teaching requiring a lot of typing, due to severe RSI). Arrangements for healthy working follow occupational health guidelines (e.g. 8 standing desks on-site, GBP2,000 spent annually on specialist seating). Exemptions are made to the policy norm (of off-peak and non-first- class travel) for health reasons (2 staff use Business Class when appropriate).  Returning from leave is supported by institutional phased return policies. New academics retain their FTE ramp-up, while PGRs receive 12-month interruptions for parental leave, and on return have a no-fees extension, phasing back to studies. In the period 60 PGRs interrupted for personal reasons (16 paternity/maternity; 4 switched full to part-time).  Flexible/remote working is supported. Duties allocation processes acknowledge part-time working, various types of leave, and requests for caring/wellbeing issues. Departmental meetings are scheduled during core hours (10:00-16:00), and VPN access enables secure home-working. On- site,
 a fully multimedia-equipped room is used for Departmental Leadership meetings, enabling 2 staff to participate remotely (due to caring responsibilities/health issues).  Support for protected characteristics is embedded in University policies. Targeted promotions guidance is provided for under-represented groups. Occupational Health guidance is available to advise on reasonable adjustments for accessibility. Support for acquiring funding and accessing infrastructure is addressed in (3.iv).  Wellbeing is supported by the built environment and a culture of healthy-working. We have a rolling programme of refurbishment, e.g. daylight-LED lighting, and increased social space for serendipitous meetings. Monthly “Coffee with HoD” coffee-mornings (maintained virtually during lockdown) encourage mingling.  Page 14 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  Commitment to EDIA in our REF return  In our return we increased the proportion of female REF-eligible staff: 20% (9/46) in 2014, to 26% (15/58) in 2021.  Our output return had multiple EDIA checks. Unit-level: A committee of senior and ECR academics estimated grades. The grading protocols and membership were under continuous revision to avoid bias. We examined attributions on gender/ethnicity for systematic bias. All submitted outputs were discussed 1-on-1 with authors. Institutional: Statistics were examined by an HR team with access to protected characteristics, reporting anomalies to Units where necessary — none arose for our Unit (across ethnicity, gender, and nationality, the number of attributed outputs matched the staffing profile). Our environment statement uses exemplars drawn from across the Unit. We polled staff 3 times soliciting “success stories”, and making clear that anybody, at any career stage, can contribute. Our impact portfolio was selected on merit alone, with multiple checks at Unit, Faculty, and University level, after polling staff for cases on multiple occasions 2016-2020.  Page 15 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202  3. Income, infrastructure and facilities  3.i) Research Funding  We aim to maintain a diverse funding portfolio, whilst increasing collaboration as much as possible. Our strategy is to promote awareness for a range of mechanisms, and release scholarly time to apply, all facilitated end-to-end by support staff.  * Promoting awareness: A monthly digest of diverse opportunities is distributed to all academics. Time-critical calls are monitored by the Research Support Manager, cascaded to staff. Annual fellowship cycles are tracked in an electronic system, with automated alerts.  * Releasing ‘scholarly’ time: Our workload system leaves 0.2FTE unassigned, enabling time for free-thinking. ECRs benefit from gradual duty ramp-up (2.iii), managed via fully-open workload formulae. Regular rounds of institutional seed-funding (light-touch review) support new ideas (e.g. 3 academics hired by our People-Data-Chips initiative were supported by GBP45,000 to establish a new loT lab).  oe Peer support: Examples of successful grants are shared, alongside an established internal peer-review culture by experienced staff, and internal workshops (e.g. an annual EPSRC mock panel) disseminate best practice. School-level initiatives encourage fellowships with a wider suite of engineering perspectives, supporting cross-departmental collaboration. Mock interviews are organised for fellowships, sourcing experienced staff from across UoM.  ¢ Administrative support: The Unit has Research Support/Finance teams providing end-to-end support for project lifecycles, including all costing/administration of proposals, HR liaison, contracts, export control, and financial reporting. Each member of academic staff has a named Research Support and Research Finance officer to work with. Research Support Managers provide leadership to teams, and strategic support to the HoD.  The average annual Unit income (sum of all REF4b categories) increased 12% to GBP8,348,693, with total EU government sources more than tripling in the period, from GBP5,238,585 to GBP17,968,580. Income per FTE, per year, is shown below — in 2013/14, the Unit ranked 12% in the UK for this metric, rising through the period (2017/18, 15%), and 2018/19 (3™).  Manchester (UoA11) research income per FTE (HESA data £k per FTE)  250.0 212.4 201.8 200.0 150.0 146.4 ’ 118.5 123.8 125.0  100.0  50.0  0.0  2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19  This income came from a diversity of awards (e.g. funding from 8/9 UKRI councils) with a total of 225 awards from 80 distinct funders, equating to GBP80,905,374 revenue. The number of awards annually increased 54% in the period (26 in 2014, up to 40 in 2019). Our ECR academics are successful — of those in-post at least 2 years (8 staff), all were awarded external funding as PI.  Page 16 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  Major awards (revenue to Manchester) include: 4 programme grants (totalling GBP4,699,231), H2020 EuroEXA (Goodacre/Lujan, GBP5,113,623), MMPATHIC (Ananiadou GBP2,923,765), EPSRC RAIN Hub (Furber, GBP4,131,580), EnnCORE (Cordeiro, GBP1,344,249), SCorCH (Reger, GBP1,034,990), ERC Advanced Grant BIMPC (Furber, GBP1,804,332), UKRI Software Sustainability Institute (Goble, GBP2,944,433).  Manchester share of UoA 11 research income in UK institutions  8.0% 7.1% 7.0%  6.0% 5.4%  5.0% 4.3% 4.3% 4.5% 4.0% 3.0% 2.0% 1.0% 0.0%  2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19  5.8%  Prestigious awards (i.e. highly competitive) include: EU FET Flagship Human Brain Project (Furber, 2013-23); 2x RAEng Fellowships (Pop 2015; Petoumenos 2019); RAEng 10-year Emerging Technologies Chair (Fisher, 2019); CityVerve SmartCity Demonstrator (Taylor, 2016); RAEng Industrial Chair (Lujan 2019), Wolfson Research Merit Award (Lujan, 2019).  Exemplars of funding enabling high-quality outputs:  e PAMELA programme grant (EP/K008730/1) enabled the Distinguished Paper Award at the PLDI conference (REF2: D’Antras et al 2017).  o EPSRC CDT (EP/1028099/1) supported PGR Nikolaou on an output which unified 20 years of work in Boosting algorithms, awarded “ACM Computing Notable article of 2016” (REF2: Nikolaou et al 20186).  o A Royal Society URF for Korovin supported research (REF2: Currin et al 2017) which developed the world’s first implementation of a non-deterministic Turing Machine in DNA.  eo EPRSC grant (EP/N035127/1) developed a unified statistical foundation for the stability of feature selection (REF2: Nogueira et al 2018).  Exemplars of funding enabling high-quality impact:  o EuroEXA (H2020-754337, Goodacre) investigated co-desighing systems and low-level architectures in collaboration with an SME, /ceotope Ltd - leading to the company being named the UK’s fastest growing hardware company (2,331% growth during collaborations, source: 2019 Deloitte UK Technology “Fast 507).  ¢ MRC grant (MR/L01078X/1, Ananiadou) supported RobotAnalyst, a text-mining system to accelerate document screening in systematic reviews: the system influenced NICE guidelines, and is used by over 200 organisations worldwide. The techniques were adapted for industrial impact via Pacific Life (PL) Insurance, for text-mining to support underwriting in health insurance. In 2017, PL funded a project (GBP366,000) and extended 2019-21 (GBP580,000), to build this into a commercial system, underwriteMe, now used by several major insurance providers.  Page 17 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  3.ii) Organisational Infrastructure (institutional level)  Institutional investment for Research Support: The Research Lifecycle Programme is a GBP15,000,000 series of investments (2017-22), with Taylor in the Unit is academic lead, aiming to transform research support, removing administrative barriers.  During the REF period, Faculty Research Support Teams and separate Research Finance Teams (totalling approximately 60FTE, where 5 support the Department of Computer Science) assisted with all aspects from outlines/costings, to HR-liaison for appointments, and end-of-project financial reporting. In parallel: a Research Strategy and Innovation team (9FTE) assist with strategic partnerships; the Knowledge Exchange team (SF TE) support KTPs/IAAs, and the Innovation Factory Ltd (IF), a wholly-owned UoM company, handled commercialisation of University innovations - the Unit has an assigned IF “partner”, based in our building, who pro-actively pursues IP opportunities. A central Contracts team deal with all legal issues and NDAs.  Investment in Relevant Research Areas: The institutional Digital Futures platform stimulates and supports collaboration in digital technologies — UoM employs 6FTE support staff for this, and the Unit plays a leading role with Taylor as Director, and Jay on the Management Board. The Pankhurst Institute channels expertise in healthcare technologies: two Unit staff provide leadership - interim Institute Director (Taylor) and Research Director (Kaski), and investments from UoM, EPSRC, and The Alan Turing Institute provide a working budget of GBP25,000,000.  Technical/Support Staff: Research IT maintains 40FTE baselined staff: 2 group leaders, 25 Research Software Engineers, 13 infrastructure engineers. This enables an agile approach to tools and secondment, whilst supporting institutional memory. Outcomes: The Unit costed 33.5 years of RSE time into funded projects, e.g. a COVID rapid-response collaboration (Jay, COV0659, GBP412,720), an evaluation framework for the Test & Trace programme: two reports (using the software) delivered to Sage via SPI-M.  High Performance Compute: The Institution maintains a compute facility of 18,512 CPU cores (varying for workload) and 90 Nvidia v100s. This pool is regularly refreshed (2014-20, GBP4,000,000), plus GBP100,000 annual spend on AWS GPU time. The Unit utilised over 284 CPU/GPU years, e.g. large-scale GPU benchmarks against our SpiNNaker neuromorphic machine.  Subscriptions/Collections: UoM provides site licences for Overleaf, Dropbox, Office365, Zoom, Teams, and Mathematica — available for all stafffPDRAs/PGRs. CS-specific licences are paid by the Unit (e.g. Cadence for circuit design).  3.iii) Support Infrastructure within the Unit Unit investment for recruitment into strategic research areas is covered in 1.ii.  Estate/Facilities: The Unit invests to support distinctive areas of research, for example — bespoke power/air-con space for SpiNNaker (GBP200,000), securing availability to the EU for the foreseeable future; and a ‘Living Lab’ for cognitive robotics research (GBP250,000). The Unit benefits from the ongoing GBP1,000,000,000 institutional master-plan, developing labs to support interdisciplinary research in robotics and computer engineering.  Technical and Support Staff: In the period, the Unit funded four technicians to support specialist research infrastructure, requiring expertise beyond that available from institutional Research IT — e.g. one provides extensive experience with chip design CAD software (helping PGRs/PDRAs), and another was a key contributor to SpiNNaker, assembling and fault-checking the final machine.  The Unit also baselined a Software Engineer who developed a comprehensive infrastructure to support our REF submission, also deployed across the entire Institution. This included a fully- algorithmic optimisation scheme to select/attribute outputs, (thus avoiding unconscious bias, and ensuring compliance with REF2021), collaboratively developed with academics (Brown, Pratt- Hartmann).  Page 18 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  3.iv) EDIA in Acquiring Funding/Accessing Infrastructure  We summarise some specific actions in the Unit, implementing strategy Principle 4 (Responsibility). The overall EDIA initiative is detailed in Section 2.xi.  Individual Mentoring: We host highly-focused individuals, some challenged by social interactions. On 2 specific occasions during the period, individuals received additional mentoring (from a trained senior Professor) on grant-writing and PGR supervision.  Workload: The Departmental Leadership Team is conscious that individuals with protected characteristics are often requested to serve on institutional committees/initiatives — and can be overloaded, which may affect research. To avoid this, our duty-allocation system is fully-transparent, and statistics on such assignments are delivered annually to the HoD for any corrective action.  Opportunities: We heavily promote gender-specific opportunities (e.g. L'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science Programme), via the departmental newsletter.  Accessibility: All buildings are wheelchair-accessible. Visually-impaired colleagues (1 academic, 2 PGRs) receive support for meetings across campus. An office was converted to fully dark-space for a PDRA with light-sensitivity (cost GBP1,500). We repurposed 2 toilets to gender-neutral. We have 1 Stonewall-trained LGBTQ+ ally to support gender-transitioning staff/students. UoM provides licences for assistive technologies (e.g. MindGenius for dyslexia, JAWS screen-reader).  3.v) How we use our Infrastructure and Expertise for Impact  Significant institutional infrastructure exists to support KTPs/IAAs, IP exploitation, and general acceleration of impact opportunities (1.iii for details).  Unit staff provided short-term consultancy for large organisations, e.g. ARM (Brown/Furber), GCHQ (Pettifer), BBC (Jay), Babylon Health (Schmidt), Elsevier (Goble), and for local SMEs: UrbanChain (Banach), Tachyum Ltd (Furber).  Examples directly relating to our REF impact portfolio and inward investment:  eo Cootes consulted for Aviagen, one of the world’s leading breeders of chickens, applying computer vision systems to improve health of their stock (see impact case).  o Kotselidis is 0.5FTE as Cybersecurity Manager for KTM A.G., the largest EU manufacturer of powered motorcycles: this enabled ELEGANT (H2020-957286, EUR4,983,250), developing secure vehicle-to-vehicle communications.  3.vi) Specialist Research Infrastructure  Cognitive Robotics Lab: a dedicated “Living Lab”, for human-robot experiments, laid out as a living space. The lab has 9 robot platforms including iCub, Pepper (x3), Sawyer, Giraff, and Nao (x3), enabled by a GBP250,000 institutional investment.  Interaction Analysis/Modelling Suite: equipped for user evaluations, including Tobii eye-trackers, and galvanic skin-response equipment. This enabled collaborations with BBC, that in turn supported the BBC Data Science Partnership.  Internet of Things: An institutional investment (GBP45,000) supports oT research, including  Meshlium Scanners for estimation of crowd density, and Libelium Cymblots for monitoring environmental parameters.  Page 19 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  3.vii) Shared Research Infrastructure  SpiNNaker is a unique neuromorphic computer, designed/built at Manchester, available through the EU FET Flagship Human Brain Project. This is available for use by any lab world-wide — and at the time of writing has run 5 million jobs for over 400 users worldwide.  FAIRDOM-SEEK (led by Goble) is a software platform for systems biologists to organise FAIR research outputs: the system is used worldwide by 140 major projects - including national programmes in patient data-sharing (Germany), and crop plant data-sharing (Belgium, France). Within this, FAIRDOMHub is a web-accessible registry for assets of biology projects: used by 204 projects, including the COVID disease paths international collaboration of 259 researchers.  Robotics: Several UoM projects (e.g. H2020 MoveCare) enable equipment-sharing between institutions, e.g. the Giraff telepresence robot, and the GBP30,000 Sawyer, used by students from Italy, and Waseda University (Japan).  An exa-scale HPC system is being constructed by the Unit (H2020 EuroEXA) that minimizes energy consumption, with a world-leading 100kW per-rack thermal density infrastructure. With 256 compute nodes (each consisting of a hybrid FPGA+CPU custom architecture) the system is one of the largest FPGA-accelerated clusters in the world, consisting 544 Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGA devices. The system is currently used by 15 development teams across 7 European nations.  3.viii) Benefits In-Kind  Intellectual Property:  e ARM Ltd donate design specifications for the ARM Cortex-M4, valued by ARM at GBP1,
500,000 annually - this enables the SpiNNaker2 project. A previous similar in-period donation of the ARM968 architecture enabled the original SpiNNaker. ARM also donate GBP350,000 annually (unrestricted funds) to maintain our ARM Centre of Excellence status.  eo BBC donated GBP380,000 plus industry-confidential data (e.g. interaction data for iPlayer). This supported 3 iCASE studentships and 5 internships.  Equipment:  * Robotics: including a GBP200,000 iCub robot, from Italian Research Council on indefinite loan to Cangelosi — this is used in e.g. the UKRI TAS Node on Trust, EP/V026682/1.  eo FPGA hardware totalling GBP100,000, from Xilinx Inc., e.g. VCU118 kits (Koch/Kotselidis) enabling a novel secure FPGA Operating System (REF2: Vaishnav et al 2020).  eo Computing power: A collaborative research agreement with AIST Japan enables access to the AIST Cloud Compute Facility providing over 400 GPUs.

Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society  4.i) Enabling Academic Collaboration  Our recruitment strategy (2.i, implementing P1: Critical Mass/Complementarity) leads to a diverse pool of expertise, with complementary interests — staff willing and able to “/ook outwards” to other disciplines/institutions (P3: Ambition/Curiosity).  This expertise is sustained and recognised - see Section 1.iv for how this is achieved.  Building on this solid base, Principle 2 (Empowerment/Support) leads us to provide the funding and opportunities to launch new collaborations, as our people see fit.  ¢ Funding: University-level seed-funding is available to stimulate collaboration - e.g. School of Engineering collaborative grants, GBP50,000 maximum, multiple annual rounds, with light- touch review. Within the Unit, an equal distribution of flexible funding to groups (GBP120,000 in 2019/20) supports both serendipitous and planned cross-institutional visits.  eo Opportunities within/beyond UoM are promoted widely, while local events enable meetings, e.g. the IDSAI “Advances in Data Science” seminars (43 since 2016) are highly cross- disciplinary, and cross-institutional in audience. In the Unit, our culture of collegiality and openness (P4: Responsibility) leads to exchange of opportunities among staff (example in 4.ii) and a light-touch visitor policy supports short-term visits.  Outcomes:  Collaborative projects: Across 52 EU projects, we partnered with 660 different organisations. We have 8 long-standing partners, each collaborating on 10+ EU projects: Barcelona Supercomputing Centre (23 projects); CNRS France (14); INRIA (10); CNR Italy (10); Fraunhofer (14); EMBL (14); CEA France (10); and Edinburgh (11).  For UKRI, we held 104 collaborative projects (with 46 UK academic institutions) where 44/104 involved another UoM Unit, showing local cross-disciplinary working. We hosted 195 visitors (35 different countries): 41/568 staff hosted an international visitor in the period.  Collaborative outputs: We published over 1200 papers with co-authors from 66 countries: including 27 EU member states (34/44 European countries), and 19 outputs with African nations: South Africa (12 outputs), Egypt (3), Zambia (3), Namibia (1). Our top 5 collaborating nations: Germany (142 outputs), USA (115), China (91), France (78), Brazil (69).  0 @° 0 ASIA NORTH AMERICA Lg ] Atlantic ®o Fo) & oO Pacific Ocean (1 Ocean 0 @ ° AFRICA 08 @ sbuth america . — pysTRALRC Q Ocean oO (7) b Bing ©2020 HERE, © 2020 Microsoft Corporation  Page 21 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  Exemplar academic collaborations/networks/partnerships:  Local: [ J  Authors from the Unit contributed to Manchester’s REF2 return for 7 other UoAs, with a total of 17 outputs across Medicine, Public Health, Allied Health, Psychology, Biology, Physics, Business and Law.  Vigo (collaboration between UoA11 and UoA5) led the CS elements of BritainBreathing, a nationwide Citizen Science project, to study seasonal allergies/asthma. The project works with the British Society for Immunology, and is an impact case (UoAS5).  UoM Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence has 974 members: 685 UoM academics/PDRAs, 137 PGRs, 106 businesses, 46 from other academic institutions. In the Unit, Ananiadou is Deputy Director, allocated 0.2FTE.  Thomas Ashton Institute is a faculty-led initiative, with elements led by the Unit (Ananiadou, Jay) - a partnership with the UK Health/Safety Executive, focusing on understanding workplace injuries.  National:  The VADA Programme Grant (GBP4,557,635, with Oxford/Edinburgh) developed end-to- end automation of a data preparation pipeline — results commercialised in a spin-out (VADA Ltd), applied (via KTP) to reduce the cost of on-boarding client data with a local SME, Peak ai.  In Robotics and Autonomous Systems, the RAIN hub (GBP12,203,190, EPSRC) develops nuclear robotics for extreme environments, stimulating collaboration between EEE and CS, including verification of systems (Fisher/Dixon), and ethics/transparency in human- robot interaction (Cangelosi/Dennis).  International:  EU FET Flagship Human Brain Project. The Unit (Furber, Lester, Garside, Rhodes) plays a leading role, joining a consortium of over 100 universities to explore brain-inspired computing, and how SpiNNaker can accelerate brain research. Furber leads the HBP neuromorphic sub-project, and sits on the HBP Science Infrastructure Board.  ELIXIR. In eScience (Goble) we have long-standing collaborations to develop infrastructure managing biological data, e.g. ELIXIR, the European inter-governmental Research Infrastructure for Life Sciences, where Goble leads the UK Node (18 organisations), enabling our participation in seven EU projects (46 organisations, 23 countries), including the US National Institutes of Health and seven pharmaceutical companies.  OpenPHACTS: Goble/Pettifer/Stevens developed an entity-matching method, incorporated into the EU OpenPHACTS platform for pharmacological data. This prompted adoption of knowledge graphs by the pharma industry - the system (with our method at its core) has processed over 500m queries, from public/private organisations worldwide.  EuroEXA: Goodacre is Technical Director for the 16-partner, EUR19,949,023programme, delivering infrastructures for exascale technology - deployed by 15 international application teams in climate/weather, physics/energy, and life-science/bioinformatics.  Japan AIST: We maintain a partnership with the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST). Funding (donated by AIST) enables extended visits by Cangelosi/Ananiadou, and PGRs/PDRAs (total 50-person months). In 2017-20 this enabled 16 published articles.  Page 22 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  4.ii) Developing Relationships with Research Users  Fostering our interfaces for impact (1.iii) provides a base of long-standing industrial partners. These are exploited by ECR academics, who regularly partner with established staff as mentors to “bring them on-board” (Principle 4: Responsibility, our open and collegiate culture). New partnerships are also enabled by sabbatical/secondment policies (2.iv), for example, Kotselidis extended a sabbatical at KTM A.G. Ltd into a part-time industrial appointment (3.v), enabling the H2020 ELEGANT project (EUR4,983,250) on secure vehicle communications.  We provide examples where the virtuous circle (1.ii) has enriched our environment: materially (via inward investment) and intellectually (driving new cross-theme research directions), e.g.:  AstraZeneca. Senior staff member, Brass, introduced an AstraZeneca contact to a then junior staff member (Brown), leading to a fruitful reciprocal research collaboration. This was supported by Unit- funded visits, and 2 PhD co-supervisions (2014-15), leading to an AstraZeneca investment of GBP400,000 (2016) to support Brown (A.l. theme) and Jay (Human Centred Computing). Outcomes: Methods for statistical biomarker selection, with a user-informed and co-designed visualisation, how being integrated into AstraZeneca workflows.  BBC Research & Development. In 2017, UoM started a 5-year Partnership with BBC R&D. The Unit funded initial interactions — enabling a funded project (EP/M017133/1), and a PGR internship. This stimulated institutional investment of GBP22,000 (2016, matched by BBC) to create a university-wide network fostering interdisciplinary data science. We authored a White Paper, ‘Challenges/Opportunities in Data Science’ (now a standard BBC reference), and embedded PDRAs into BBC labs. This led to a BBC investment of GBP380,000, enabling 5 internships and 3 iCASEs.  ARM Ltd. A long-term relationship enables access to ARM IP. Exemplar outputs include the SpiNNaker architecture, and a 28nm System-on-Chip architecture (EuroEXA). In 2018 we were awarded the ARM Centre of Excellence status, providing a recurring donation (GBP50,000 p.a.) to support activities. This supports ECRs in establishing career directions (e.g. Pop, Cordeiro, Pavlidis).  4.iii) Wider contributions to the Economy and Society  Translational research in text mining of MP enquiries. As a Parliamentary Fellow, Batista has contributed to Government efficiency — the research is being deployed in the House of Commons Library to accelerate searching 600,000 historical MP enquiries.  We helped define the national curriculum. Furber chaired the Royal Society advisory committee “After the reboot’ (2017), advising government on the CS curriculum. Supporting this, the Unit hosted the North-West Regional Centre for the ‘Computing at School’ initiative, providing professional development opportunities for teachers.  Responding to demand from local SMEs for skills in Al. and Data Science, we co-lead the GBP6,000,000 ERDF “Al Foundry” project providing Al. expertise to 170+ Manchester SMEs, helping them develop new products/services.  A collaboration between Vigo and Salford NHS authority increased usability of NHS software. A medication safety dashboard, deployed in 43 GP surgeries (local population: 250,000) was analysed by Vigo, resulting in changes to the layout/interaction protocols.  We enhance the economic efficiency of academic networks via the EasyChair conference management system, designed/maintained by the Unit (Voronkov) — with over 3,000,000 registered users, and serving over 83,000 conferences worldwide.  We contribute to national digital skills training via the Institute of Coding (Embury/Jay). We develop tools for teaching software engineering based on industry input, informed via empirical software engineering research on historical student code collections.  Page 23 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  4.iv) Engaging with Diverse Communities via our Research  We partner with several NHS organisations (e.g. Christie Cancer Hospital), to deploy research: e.g. local Christie clinicians use the work of Embury/Brass on ‘data journeys’ (see REF2) to assess patient data-flow.  Batista works with Amnesty International human rights investigators (ESRC ES/R00899X/1) on hate-speech detection.  Jay/Vigo engaged with the Manchester Museum to develop a citizen-science app for digitisation of a fossil collection (800+ downloads), also resulting in a CHI workshop paper.  Parsia leads our LegalTech Initiative engaging with a consortium of local law firms—the initiative won “Alliance of the Year” at the 2019 British LegalTech Awards.  Public engagement: Jay presented programmes (BBC, ITV) about robots and society. Reger/Cordeiro have duties (0.2FTE) for Public Engagement/Liaison supporting events such our presence at British Science Week, and BlueDot Festival.  Pupil work placements: The Unit welcomes young people (age 15-17) for research-based placements—in the period we hosted 10 (plus 4 cancelled due to COVID). For example, 3 pupils in 2019 created a dataset, used by Batista in a proposal.  4.v) Contribution to Sustainability of the Discipline  REF2021 Guidelines: Jay led the Software Sustainability Institute team (9 authors, 36 reviewers: including UKRI and the Society of Research Software Engineering) to create REF2021 software output guidelines.  The Software Sustainability Institute facilitates the advancement of research software through training, advocacy, policy, and research. As Research Director, Jay leads the SSI's Open Evidence Bank and research strategy.  Training: Our staff taught in 17 events over the period, e.g. Estonian Summer School in ML (Brown) 2019; European Summer School on Logic, Language and Intelligence (Sattler/Parsia) 2014-2019. The Unit hosted events, e.g. SpiNNaker workshops 2016-19: 146 people (18 countries), supporting international activity in neuromorphic computing.  Responsiveness to national and international priorities:  ¢ Mental health: In recognition of a national need, NewMind (with Taylor as academic lead) built a community around technology for mental health, and (via its road-map) fed into the cross-council mental health initiative.  eo Open Data in Research: We are a founding contributor (via Goble) to the influential FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for data management. Goble maintains leadership roles in various FAIR advocacy organisations.  eo Hardware Security: Goodacre led a bid from 26 businesses across 8 sectors, and 8 universities, for the ISCF Digital Security by Design programme. This resulted in a GBP200,000,000 programme — GBP70,000,000 from government, and GBP130,000,000 industrial co-investment (e.g. Microsoft, Google) — with Goodacre as the Director. To date, 12 projects across 15 Universities have received GBP20,000,000 in funding.  Page 24 Unit-level environment template (REF5b) REF202]  * SmartCities: CityVerve (GBP10,000,000, 2016-18) was a landmark DCMS/InnovateUK project, led by the Unit for the University (Taylor), partnering with 20 organisations, delivering a more connected Manchester — sub-projects included data collection/analysis on COPD symptoms in the Manchester Corridor (Jay).  eo Trustworthy Autonomous Systems: Fisher was academic lead for the development of a Strategic Priorities Fund bid, leading to a UKRI programme totalling GBP33,000,000.  Exemplars of interdisciplinary research:  In collaboration with the Institute of Neuroscience/Medicine at Julich Research Centre, Furber et al. used SpiNNaker to implement a cortex model in biological real-time (Rhodes et al, 2019), out- performing HPC/GPU implementations (see impact case). Working with AstraZeneca, and closing the virtuous circle, Brown extended a theoretical foundation for feature selection (see REF2014) to cover prognostic/predictive biomarker selection in personalised medicine (REF2: Sechidis ef al 2018). In Medical Imaging, Cootes/Lindner developed methods in Computer Vision, and commercialised BoneFinder, identifying skeletal structures in 2D medical images.  4.vi) Indicators of Wider Influence  Journal Editorships (65 total), including 5 Editor-in-Chiefs, e.g. Computer Journal (Furber, 2016- 20); J.

"Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Institution: University of Plymouth Unit of Assessment: UoA11 Computer Science and Informatics 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy Highlights  •  • • •  •  We broadened research scope significantly with growing numbers of research applications in health technology, sustainability, agritech, and offshore renewable energy (ORE). These areas are central to the University of Plymouth’s long-term strategy. Staff increased from 11.2 FTEs to 14.62; refreshed by seven new ECRs (section 2). Research income from UK, EU and international sources rose to £7.7M from £6.7M (section 3). A Cyber-SHIP lab was set up with over £3M of funding, a new and unique research facility designed to address key cyber security challenges facing the shipping industry (sections 3 and 4) A Big Data group was set up and interdisciplinary collaborations were invigorated through a new School structure (sections 3 and 4).  1 Overview  Research in Computer Science and Informatics at the University of Plymouth (UoP) is mainly carried out at two research centres, the Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems (CRNS) and the Centre for Security, Communications and Networks (CSCAN). Both centres form part of the School of Engineering, Computing and Mathematics (SECaM) within the Faculty of Science and Engineering (FoSE). Several staff in UoA11 occupy leading roles in the Faculty (Jones, Executive Dean; Ghita, Associate Dean for International and Postgraduate; Clarke, Deputy Head of SECaM), which provides a strong position within the Faculty and University and enables impact on strategic decisions, including on research and postgraduate matters. In REF2014 UoP submitted 12.4 category A staff to UoA11 in a submission that was focused on Cognitive Robotics and Neural Computation. The present REF2021 submission contains 17 category A (14.62 FTEs) and 7 category B staff representing 10% of the independent researchers in FOSE. The submission has a much wider scope than previously due to growth and major restructuring: In 2019, the former School of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics (SoCEM) merged with the School of Engineering to form the School of Engineering, Computing and Mathematics. The School merger created a synergistic mix of academic disciplines, strengthening research through new interdisciplinary collaborations within the three core subject areas in the new School -- Engineering, Computing and Mathematics. This interdisciplinary environment aligns with Government and EPSRC priority areas of clean growth, digitalisation, autonomy, and health technology. It enhances sharing of good practice and alignment of processes and initiatives to maximise research and teaching benefits and effectiveness across the School. It also enables more effective interaction between research groups and training of researchers for industrial and research needs aligned to the future needs of the country, including the challenges of the fourth Industrial revolution and global Page 1  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) digital transformation. Therefore, CSCAN and CRNS sit together in a supportive environment and form a natural unit submission. Furthermore, in 2016 Cangelosi and Marocco initiated the formation of a new BigData group. This responded to the enormous growth the field has seen in recent years reflected in UK Government strategy, especially Industry 4.0, which puts Computer Science, Data Science and AI at the core of developments across industries. In the reporting period, five lecturers were recruited to strengthen AI and Big Data in UoA11. Compared to REF2014, research now falls into four broad thematic areas: Robotics; Computational Neuroscience (REF2014); Big Data & Artificial Intelligence; Cyber Security & Networks (new). SciVal data confirm that the majority of outputs cover core Computer Science topics (39.2%), Maths (including theoretical/data analyses, 11.3%) and Engineering (21.8 %). The remaining 27.7% cover a broad range of interdisciplinary topics, prominently in Neuroscience and Psychology (through research in Computational Neuroscience) and the Health/Medical area (Social robotics, HCI, and BigData). Given the interdisciplinary nature of research, UoA11 contributes strongly to the objectives of the University’s three strategic research institutes (https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/institutes): • • •  Marine Institute via Marine Cyber Security; AI, Optimisation and Data Analysis; Autonomous Robotics. Plymouth Institute of Health and Care Research via Social and Healthcare Robotics (impact case 1); Computational Neuroscience; BigData for e-health. Sustainable Earth Institute via Agricultural robotics (impact case 2); Robotics and AI for Renewable Energy, especially offshore.  Strategic Aims Our mission is to promote innovative research in core and applied Computer Science domains that reaches the widest national and international recognition and highest impact. Figure 1 displays performance metrics of all UoA11 research outputs over the REF period. The figure shows that 20.5% of outputs perform in the top 10% worldwide and 2 to 5 % in the top 1%. More than a quarter of outputs appeared in the top 10% of journals and 2 to 7% in the top 1% (as measured by ‘CiteScore’, the average citation count per document in a journal). The plots confirm consistency of this outstanding performance over time. Based on this data and wider achievements outlined in the subsequent sections, we have met all strategic aims identified in the REF2014 submission (see especially the highlights at the top of this section).  Page 2  Unit-level environment template (REF5b)  Figure 1: Performance metrics for all UoA11 outputs published during the reporting period.  CRNS and CSCAN developed over more than ten years and are now well consolidated in the School with excellent visibility worldwide. Individuals have their main affiliation with one centre, but are often associated with secondary units. Both centres have an excellent work ethos, highly motivated members, international reputation, and impact that grew strongly during the assessment period. Centre for Robotic and Neural Systems (CRNS). https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/robotics-neural-systems [Category A: Belpaeme, Gaudl, Gianni, Howard, Kelefouras, Li, Palomino, Stoelen, Stuart, Walker, Wennekers, Yang. Category B: Borisyuk, Cangelosi, Lemaignan, Merrison-Hort. Other previous members: Bugmann, Culverhouse, Marocco, Masala, Metta, Millard, Rahat, Rodrigues,Thill] The strategic vision of the CRNS embraces world-class interdisciplinary research investigating the physical and functional basis of perception, behaviour and cognition in both, natural and artificial neural and autonomous systems (including humans, animals and robots). The CRNS has established an international research hub in the integration of cognitive robotics and computational neuroscience. We pursue our aims through publication in leading journals, development of state of the art robotics labs, and research income from leadership in large, EPSRC and EU international consortia. With a strong track record and international reputation for leadership in cognitive robotics, CRNS explores models of action and language learning, developmental and epigenetic robotics, human-robot interaction for children and the elderly, or mathematical and computational modelling of visual and auditory perception. We also study nonlinear dynamics to model working memory, timing, and learning processes; explore motor learning and embodiment, and the application of computational and robotics modelling to psychology, neuroscience, and animal behaviour. Given the Centre’s highly interdisciplinary approach, it collaborates with many researchers in the University and worldwide. For example, Belpaeme Page 3  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) cooperates with Luc Steeles (Universidad Pompeu Fabra) on the Evolution of Language or Bram Vanderborght (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) on Human Computer Interaction; Cangelosi works with Giorgio Metta (Scientific Director of the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia) on Cognitive Robotics or Steve Furber (Uni Manchester) on neuro-inspired hardware for robots. Borisyuk develops models of tremor with Nada Yousif at Imperial and tadpole spinal cord models with Alan Roberts from UWE Bristol; Howard published on limb control with Dan Wolpert (Columbia) and Konrad Koerding (Upenn); Wennekers develops models of brain-function with Palm (Universitaet Ulm) and language with Pulvermueller (Freie Universitaet Berlin). Strong research strands evidenced by our selected outputs include: [Robotic Control; Sensors and Actuators:] Stoelen and Howard lead Impact case 1 on agricultural robotics, where low-cost public domain harvesting robots are deployed in real environments. Chen works on robot controllers for a wide range of applications. His publications have attracted an immense level of scientific attention in terms of citations. [Social and cognitive robotics:] Impact case 2 by Belpaeme, Cangelosi & Gaudl considers robot applications in social, educational and health contexts. Their work on robotsupported child learning has set new scientific agendas and attracted a wide press attention including front page coverage by Science Robotics and Scientific American. [Computational Neuroscience:] Borisyuk, Wennekers & Howard have a long-standing publication record and international visibility in CNS topics such as dynamical modeling of neural systems (Borisyuk), brain-inspired language and cognition models (Wennekers) or movement control (Howard).  During the evaluation period additional staff were recruited to counteract staff turnover. Three early career lecturers complement and extend our core competences in Robotics: Gianni is an internationally recognised expert in search and rescue robotics and multi-robot systems. He also has responsibility for our Nvidia Lab. Gaudl’s research is focused on AI, games, animal behaviour and low-cost robotics, especially in the health sector. Li is an expert in Machine Learning, Control Theory, Smart Materials and Soft Robotics. All three are highly promising researchers with a quickly increasing international visibility evidenced by their research outputs. Gianni and Gaudl secured grant income soon after hired. Gianni started two projects about aerial robot swarms for offshore wind turbine inspection and decommissioning nuclear submarines (with Babcock, UK); Gaudl has a significant role in EPIC2, where robotic systems are explored in health care environments. This is a major project headed at the University’s new strategic Centre for Health Technology (https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/epic ). As an important element of growth, the research scope of the unit has been significantly broadened and extended beyond Robotics and Neural Computation into wider Artificial Intelligence technologies. This new initiative focuses on statistical learning, machine learning and big data as well as optimisation methods in various contexts. It responds to strong trends in Computer Science research and Industry requirements, and is well aligned with UK research strategies: For instance, the EPSRC intends to grow its “Artificial Intelligence” theme, and the UK Government’s Industrial Strategy published in 2017 includes AI as one of four grand challenges. Three ECRs joined since 2017, covering a variety of complementary topics in these areas (Walker: AI and optimisation, Kelefouras: optimised computing hardware; Palomino: sentiment analysis). Page 4  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) The scope of this initiative is even wider: members of the Centre (Cangelosi, Masala) initiated the implementation of a Big Data research group, which recruits members from across the School (Computing, Maths, Engineering) and serves as a platform for projects within SECaM as well as with other units (Palomino, Gianni and Kelefouras work with the Centre for Health Technology; Wennekers and Howard with the School of Psychology). Centre for Security, Communications and Networks (CSCAN). https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/centre-for-security-communications-and-networkresearch [Category A: Clarke, Ghita, Jones, Papadaki, Sun, Tam. Category B: Furnell, Other: Shiaeles, Stengel] CSCAN dates back to the 1980s, with a proven long-term research pedigree, including both, collaborative work with industry and participation in European research initiatives. Work at the Centre focuses on Digital Forensics, Human Aspects of Cyber Security, Networking and Communications, and Marine and Maritime Cyber Security. Some highlights (see submitted outputs) are early studies for user authentication using bio-metrics and behaviour profiles (Clarke, Furnell, Papadaki), information security compliance modelling in organisations (Furnell), content-based video quality prediction (Sun), internet traffic classification (Ghita), or Tam’s highly recognised work about Android malware behaviour reconstruction. CSCAN has recently set-up a new Maritime Cyber Threats research group (Jones, Tam) which aligns with the University’s focus upon the marine sector. The group brings together leading-edge multidisciplinary research and practical expertise from across the University and beyond. It is uniquely placed to make significant contributions in maritime cyber-security. The group is supported by grants from H2020 (CYBER-MAR) and Research England (CYBER-SHIP, £3M). An ECR, Tam, has significantly contributed to setting up the Lab; she has been appointed to a lecturer post in 2019. A second ECR (Asad, UoA12) was appointed lecturer in 12/2019. The work at CSCAN has led to many successful postgraduate projects and associated publications. About half of UoA11’s PhD completions were located in CSCAN. In addition to an active base of postgraduate and postdoctoral research, CSCAN’s research also underpins MSc and MRes programmes at UoP. The CSCAN Network of European Universities (established in 2004) continues to flourish and facilitates research co-operation with academic institutions across Europe: the University of Applied Sciences, Darmstadt, Furtwangen University of Applied Sciences and, since February 2015, the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. This has created a community of 17 doctoral students throughout the reporting period. Future Strategy The launch of SECaM in 2019 and the new UoP institutes - Marine, Health, and Sustainability - provided an opportunity to revisit research and impact strategy for the next 5 years. We installed a new research group on BigData and AI in CRNS, which now contains Robotics, Page 5  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Computational Neuroscience (REF2014), Big Data and AI. We embrace new opportunities in digitalisation, artificial intelligence and robotics emerging in the 4th Industrial Revolution and identified in the UK Industrial Strategy. Our objectives are •  •  •  •  •  Grow the staff base in Computing in the School to extend the range of competences and operational power. Four new lecturers/senior lecturers have already been hired after the staff cut-off date for this REF; a full professor post in AI has been advertised to further strengthen leadership. Prioritize excellent, impact-yielding research, aligned to UKRI strategies and supported by enhanced international collaborations, increasing the number of world-leading publications and grant income, and maintaining an outward focus that informs international facilities and national policies. Maximize sustainable research impact, by taking full advantage of our new School and its state-of-the-art infrastructure, of growing SME networks and multidisciplinary industrial projects. Strengthen our CPD provision, and continue to expand our research-informed, educational and public engagement programmes to increase awareness of the importance of Computer Science in pupils and the public. Sustain and consolidate our outstanding team of postdoctoral researchers, and increase our complement of PGR students.  Open Access Policy The UoA complies fully with REF Open Access policies and the School encourages researchers to use this option. The University published its Research Data Management policy in 2018 to ensure data integrity, discoverability and reuse throughout the lifecycle of 
research projects. Publications are made available publicly online (https://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk/), usually under OA licenses funded by grants. Members of UoA11 contribute to OpenAccess software, notably YARP, a widely used robotics platform developed under supervision of Metta, who held a 20% contract at UoP for 5 years during the assessment period (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YARP). Parts of YARP were developed and tested in robotics projects in Plymouth (ITALK, Poeticon). Members of UoA11 edit for Open Access journals: Wennekers (PLOS one, Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience, Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, Digital), Belpaeme (Frontiers in Robotics and AI), Cangelosi (Frontiers in Neurorobotics). Covid 19 In response to the pandemic, staff were encouraged to work from home, but can access research labs on demand where necessary, consistent with government regulations. Strict hygienic and behavioural procedures are in place throughout University buildings. Online meetings take place at increased frequency, with weekly subject group meetings, bi-weekly School meetings and monthly research planning meetings of the Centres. A SECaM research planning day took place online in 12/2020 and UoP conducted a survey of the impact of Covid19 on staff work and wellbeing.  Page 6  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) 2. People Table 1 provides staffing data. All staff are on permanent contracts, ensuring strategic continuity and job security. Three are on part-time contracts holding second appointments abroad (Stoelen, Belpaeme) or for a focus on research (Papadaki). Three researchers are professors, 6 associate professors, 7 grade 8 lecturers and one grade 7. This profile reflects the recent refreshment of our staff base, also visible in the high numbers of younger staff. Four colleagues are female (24%) and 13 male, slightly better than UK averages for females in professional Computing jobs (ca 20%, various sources) or female students in Computer Science (18%, https://www.stemwomen.co.uk/). Twelve of 17 staff have a non-British background, 8 originate from EU countries, and 4 from Asia and Southern America; 3 are from a non-Caucasian background. These numbers are indicative of a highly international and inclusive workforce; on average only 13.8% of the UK population is from an ethnic minority background. It is a stated strategic aim of SECaM to become a beacon for EDI in the university https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/about-us/university-structure/service-areas/equality-diversity-andinclusion.

Staffing strategy and staff development Our staffing strategy aims to grow excellence at all levels and to attract the best researchers in line with our objectives and needs. The international reputation of CRNS and CSCAN helps with attracting high-quality applications from around the world. Aligned with the University’s internationalisation strategy we advertise and hire internationally and expect staff to collaborate at an international level. We attempt to position the unit ideally for Industry 4.0 by interdisciplinary and international collaboration and growth of research, especially through new investments into AI and robotics. Four new lecturer/senior lecturer and one professor post have been allocated to the unit focusing on AI, robotics and cyber security. Research within the unit aligns with the University’s three strategic institute themes: Marine, Health and Sustainability. Collaborations in these areas are actively encouraged and growing. Impact is reached by working with end users and industry (Honda, Babcock, Bosch, Derriford National Trust, and others). Potential for research impact is a key element of the recruitment criteria for new staff.  Page 7  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) All submitted staff are on balanced contracts. UoP aims at a workload giving equal weight (40%) to research and teaching, and 20% to administrative responsibilities. The unit saw a large throughput of researchers in the reporting period. The majority of outward moves were due to career progression: seven junior lecturers / ECRs took offers for permanent academic posts elsewhere (Yang, Rodrigues, Lemaignan, Masala, Rahat, Shiaeles, Millard), one entered industry (Merrison-Hort). This demonstrates excellent opportunities for career development at the unit. Furthermore, three senior staff took new academic posts elsewhere (Borisyuk, Cangelosi, Furnell) and two retired (Bugmann, Culverhouse) although they are still affiliated with the unit as visiting researchers. Staff turnover allowed us to build a refreshed staff base with a wider range of skills than in the 2014 submission. This applies specifically to new topics in AI, BigData, and Marine & Cyber Security where we hired a significant number of new staff at lecturer level during the assessment period. Key appointments were in the field of AI and Optimisation (Walker, Kelefouras), Big Data (Palomino), Robotics (Gianni, Gaudl), and Cyber Security (Tam, internally promoted). These researchers have strong records of accomplishment and clear potential to generate research excellence and impact (cf. their submitted outputs; Walker and Gaudl have attracted competitive UoA internal studentships; Gaudl, Gianni and Tam brought in several research grants). Career development We have a strong commitment to developing scholars to provide leadership and sustainability, endorsing the University’s commitment to the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. The University has successfully retained the Excellence Award (see Institutional environment statement). Principles of career development apply across staff at all levels from research fellows to senior staff, with additional measures in place for new and early career researchers. All academic staff develop research plans and take part in a formal personal development scheme (PDR) to gauge performance and set objectives. Staff are evaluated annually against the previous year's objectives, their job descriptions and individual requirements. Results are propagated upwards to the HoS and Dean for School and Faculty level oversight and planning. The PDR is also a measure to communicate Faculty and School strategy downwards. New staff are allocated a mentor for one year who advises on academic issues. A wide range of training sessions is available for UoP researchers catering for people at all career stages. This extends from REF strategy, impact and Open Access issues to research and presentation skills. Sessions are delivered internally or by external trainers, in collaboration with the Doctoral College and relevant UoP units. Compulsory online courses must be undertaken and refreshed at prescribed intervals: Equality and Unconscious Bias, Mental Health Awareness, Diversity in the workplace, GDPR and Information Security. Training also takes place at School away days where identified topics are covered (eg funding opportunities and procedures; REF; research strategy). Training is monitored as part of the PDR process. The School further encourages the achievement of professional academic accreditations. UoP operates an annual promotion scheme with associated workshops to clarify processes. Promotions are awarded according to merit in accordance with defined criteria. Since 2014 one person was promoted to professor (Clarke; m), one to associate professor (Papadaki; f) and four to lecturer level (Stoelen, Tam, Lemaignan and Merrison-Hort; 3m, 1f). Clarke, Page 8  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Papadaki, Stoelen, Lemaignan and Merrison-Hort had been with the University since their PhD studies at the time of promotion, demonstrating ongoing long-time support of staff. Tam (f) entered the University as a research fellow in 2017, secured a lecturer appointment 2019 and continues to contribute to the Cyber-SHIP lab. The School also runs a scheme for semester-long sabbaticals (eg Dahl, Marroco). New Researchers and Early Career Researchers The School has a strong commitment to support young researchers and their career development. At the census date, we had seven ECRs (Tam, Gianni, Gaudl, Kelefouras, Walker, Palomino, Stoelen). Seven ECRs secured permanent academic posts elsewhere during the reporting period (Lemaignan & Yang, UWE Bristol; Masala, Manchester Metropolitan; Millard, University Lincoln; Rahat, Swansea University; Rodrigues, BCAM, Spain; Shiaeles, Portsmouth). We support research assistants and ECRs through: - Mentoring. New members of staff are allocated a research-active mentor for specific guidance on research, career development, and grant writing. - Performance Development Review (PDR). Senior members of the School who review all staff and give advice and support for development needs. - ECR Research Forum: This is a school-wide group of ECRs who self-organise to provide mutual support, with regular meetings, reading club, grant writing support, etc. - Workload adjustments. New researchers have a reduced teaching load of 20% (instead of typically 40%) and no major administrative responsibilities. - Postgraduate Teaching Certificate. Primarily a teaching course, but includes procedures and regulations relevant to research, eg PGR student supervision and Doctoral College (DC) support. - Internal courses: delivered through the DC covering a wide spectrum of skills including project management, IPR, research and presentation skills, grant writing etc. - PhD Studentships and Small Grant Competitions. In the past, more than 50% of internally funded PhD studentships and small grants were priority-allocated to ECRs to kick-start their research productivity and supervisory experience. - External visitors: The research centres run seminar series supported by the School with internal and external speakers, providing opportunities for junior staff to develop presentation skills and foster networking. Equality and Diversity As one of its strategic objectives SECaM is committed to the advancement of equality, diversity and inclusion in employment and career development. The University, the School of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics, and the School of Engineering attained Athena SWAN bronze awards in recognition of a commitment to improving gender equality in October 2018. In November 2020 the new School, SECaM, also received an Athena SWAN bronze award. https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/about-us/university-structure/service-areas/equalitydiversity-and-inclusion/athena-swan EDI issues in relation to recruitment, promotion, and research are monitored through the yearly PDR process and by research centre leads for reporting to the Faculty Research Committee. The School carefully formulates recruitment and marketing documents not to exclude under-represented groups, and aims to be able to shortlist at least one female Page 9  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) candidate for each externally advertised post. It is HR policy for recruitment panel members to receive training in equality and diversity issues. All members of staff complete compulsory online training on equality and diversity, and unconscious bias. Output selection for this REF submission followed peer rankings of up to five best outputs of each researcher by internal and external reviewers. The single best output for each researcher was chosen and the remaining outputs selected according to the rankings. There were no ambiguities of choice in the process that could have disadvantaged minorities. Several of the best papers are from active female members of the unit. The UoA submits ~24% females, slightly more than females among Computing students or in professional Computer Science jobs. In December 2020 the School has offered two new posts in AI and Cyber Security to females. In a wider context, the University provides wellbeing and counselling services, access to on-campus nurseries for staff, and it supports maternity/paternity leaves. ii. Research Students Postgraduate research students are key to our research environment. 104 PhD students completed during the reporting period, roughly 15 completions per year or 1 per FTE per year. The number of completions is stable over time. 20% of completions in the School were by females; 48% had a BAME background. Recruitment was by a variety of sources, such as four Marie Curie training networks (APRIL, SECURE, DCOMM, COGNOVO), the CSCAN Network of European Universities, a range of EU grants and additional internal studentships distributed within the School in a competitive process (~3 per year). The School secured an EPSRC DTP with a focus on Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) and provides further PhD studentships in Health & Medical Technologies for which members of UoA11 have successfully applied (Walker, Gianni). CSCAN also attracts self-funded students from Kuwait and Saudi-Arabia (> 20 students). The University considers educating the next generation of academics and researchers central to its mission. It coordinates postgraduate studies through the University’s Doctoral College (DC), such that all students receive excellent and extensive support at the same high level of quality. Recruitment follows strict procedures to guarantee equality, inclusivity and fairness, as well as wide and international advertisements of posts. A trained recruitment team reviews applications and interviews shortlisted candidates according to procedures very similar to those for standard academic posts. Students are provided with dedicated office accommodation and all necessary lab access and computing infrastructure. Depending on the funding source, special-purpose equipment, travel or other resources are provided. Where possible, students are collocated to support a lively student environment. Training and Support The DC offers a range of training courses in research and transferrable skills, such as project management, networking, career management, presentation skills, etc. Students evaluate with their supervisors which courses to take. Student members of Marie Curie training networks did benefit from additional training as part of the network, eg sessions in science communication, entrepreneurship, or the opportunity to organise a student-led conference. Supervisory teams consist of a Director of Study and a second supervisor, but can have more members if an interdisciplinary research topic requires this. A further independent UoP Page 10  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) academic ('expert commentator') reviews progress at several junctures (initial proposal, transfer report, final thesis, viva). All supervisors are trained as required by the DC. Less experienced supervisors are paired with an experienced colleague. Students are fully integrated into their Centres and the School’s research environment. They partake in regular lab meetings, internal and external seminars, and the general international research culture. They benefit from interaction with national and international visitors to the School and have a representative on the School's research committee. Progress Monitoring Comprehensive monitoring procedures are in place overseen by the DC. Frequent informal meetings are complemented by formal three-monthly meetings, annual progress reports, and crucial milestones recorded in an online monitoring system (gradbook). The expert commentator provides critical scrutiny and guidance independent of the supervisory team. As progress permits, students transfer after 12 months from an MPhil to a PhD route. 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities Our research environment is supported by state-of-the-art Infrastructure and facilities. Most researchers and all PGR students have generous office space in a modern building erected in 2002/03 that also features some of the Computing labs, lecture halls, large community areas and a cafeteria. Robotics and additional Networking and Security Labs are in buildings close-by (less than 5 minutes). 
The University is investing £50M into a new building that will host major parts of the School of Engineering, Computing and Mathematics from the start of the 2023/24 academic year. This will contain shared lab-spaces, teaching space, IT services and other facilities, notably a high-tech virtual engineering suite to which all research groups will have access. Our existing spaces in other buildings have been re-developed, with generous new space for Computer Gaming and an AR/VR laboratory. CRNS labs are supported by three technicians. Equipment has been purchased through a combination of University infrastructure investments and project budgets. The Cognitive Robotics and Human-Robot Interaction Lab hosts an iCub humanoid baby robot, one of the most advanced platforms for research on cognitive robotics. Metta, who developed the iCub platform and is now director of the Italian Institute of Technology, held a 20% Professor post at UoP for 5 years in order to collaborate on joint projects (POETICON++, SECURE, BABEL). We also have five Nao Aldebaran humanoid robots used in HRI experiments (Cangelosi, Belpaeme), a MetraLab Scitos mobile platform for research on robot companions for the elderly (Belpaeme, Gaudl, link to UoP’s Health and Care Research Institute), two manipulandum set-ups for motor neuroscience research (Howard), autonomous un-manned aerial and terrestrial vehicles for search and rescue (Gianni, linked to UoP’s Marine Institute), and custom made low-cost robots for research into swarm robotics (Millard, Gaudl). CRNS runs an Nvidia lab of powerful workstations with in total 54 Tesla GPUs (Gianni) and in collaboration with Mathematics we have access to the School’s 1024 core HPC Computer cluster for extensive simulations in Robot Learning (Cangelosi, Wennekers), Computational Neuroscience (Borisyuk, Wennekers) and BigData applications (Walker, Palomino). CRNS hosts other specialised equipment such as a Plankton Image Analyser system (Culverhouse) and an Information Visualisation Lab (Stuart).  Page 11  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) CSCAN also has an excellent modern technology infrastructure with several related computing facilities. The Cyber Security lab (Clarke, Furnell, Papadaki) is a 42-seat Security and Forensics laboratory, a custom-designed facility dedicated to activities relating to security research, related undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, and Capture-the-Flag activities. This facility represented an investment of over £200K when launched in October 2011; with additional investments of £40K in 2015 and £50K in 2019 to upgrade the computers and servers to a higher specification. All activities in the room are closely monitored utilising CCTV, traffic monitoring, firewalling, and extensive logging. Desktop PCs are controlled and audited with access to security toolkits provisioned through virtualisation (examples include hacking toolkits like Kali Linux, Social Engineering Toolset, and forensics tools as FTK). In addition, the School supports a separate Networks laboratory, which is used by the Cybersecurity students for their network technology modules. This facility has 40 seats, is equipped with £250K of Cisco and F5 networking and security equipment, and allows for a wide range of networking topologies to be deployed (covering LAN, wireless, ISP-customerto-datacentre) as well as a lab cloud and datacentre infrastructure. The Cyber-SHIP lab, linked with UoP’s Marine Institute, is a new and unique national research facility designed to address key cyber security challenges facing the shipping industry (Jones, Tam) established in November 2019 through £3million funding from Research England and industry. Dedicated space in the Marine Building has been repurposed for the lab in close proximity to the full bridge navigation simulator. The lab brings together a host of connected maritime systems currently found on an actual ship’s bridge, featuring cutting edge maritime technology including radar equipment, a voyage data recorder (VDR), an Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS), an automatic identification system (AIS) and communications devices. Experts in cyber security and information systems can now assess them for weaknesses, and identify the human and technological changes needed to make them secure for the future. The setup is unique world-wide, it engages 18 commercial UK partners and sees strong interest from overseas. https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/cyber-ship-lab The University supports research through its administrative structures: The Research and Innovation team supports the preparation of grant applications and manages grants; the IP/commercialisation committee supports exploitation of IP rights up to part-funding start-up companies (eg Stoelen’s spin-out company Fieldwork Robotics Ltd; https://fieldworkrobotics.github.io/); a new R&D fund is designed to stimulate industrial collaboration and knowledge transfer. Research Income During this REF period, the Unit has received significant income through new RCUK, EU and international grants. Figure 4 details funds received per academic year by funding source (A). Part B displays year totals and demonstrates a steady income of around £1.1M per year. The data for the 19/20 financial year ends in June.  Page 12  Unit-level environment template (REF5b)  Figure 1: A) grant income per funding source and year, B) total grant income by year, and C) total grant income by funding source.  First, we led new large, multi-national EPSRC and EU projects. An example in the Networks and Security area is the EU H2020 ICT RIA project “CYBER-TRUST: Advanced Cyber-Threat Intelligence, Detection, and Mitigation Platform for a Trusted Internet of Things” (2018 – 2021, 398,395EUR of 2,998,182EUR to the University of Plymouth; Shiaeles as technical lead, Clarke, Ghita, Papadaki, Furnell as Co-Is). Two large Robotics projects we led are the H2020 L2TOR – “Second Language Tutoring using Social Robots” (2016-2018, 544,013 EUR of 3.043 MEUR to UoP; Belpaeme, coordinator) and “MoveCare: Multipleactors Virtual Empathic Caregiver for the Elder” (2017-2019, 439kEUR to UoP; Cangelosi, coordinator). The latter two projects underpin our Impact Case Study in Social Robotics. Secondly, we contribute to large national and international research consortia. For example, CSCAN participates in the H2020 FORESIGHT project “Advanced cyber-security simulation platform for preparedness training in heterogeneous IoT, industrial and defense ecosystems” (10/19-09/21, € 290k of € 7M to UoP) and the EPSRC funded project “Identifying and Modelling Victim, Business, Regulatory and Malware Behaviours in a Changing Cyberthreat Landscape” (2013-17, £173k of £1.0M; Clarke, Furnell, Stengel, coIs). In Maritime Cybersecurity in addition to CYBER-SHIP (see above) we contribute to CYBERMAR. Both have established a new research direction within the School to address the key cyber security challenges facing the shipping industry. CYBER-MAR - “Cyber preparedness actions for a holistic approach and awareness raising in the MARitime logistics supply chain” is an H2020 project with 11 partners (09/19-08/22; € 644k of € 7.1M to UoP) (Jones, Tam). Three further large robotics projects fall in the area of health and social robotics: “DREAM: Development of Robot-Enhanced therapy for children with AutisM spectrum disorders” an EU FP7 Integrated Project (04/14-10/19; 955 kEUR of 6.432 MEUR for Plymouth; Belpaeme, PI). “EPIC: E-health - Productivity and Innovation in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly” (03/1704/20, £1,7M of £3.4M to UoP), which is funded by the European Regional Development Page 13  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Fund (ERDF) (Cangelosi, Dahl, Belpaeme) and EPIC 2, a follow-up of the EPIC project also funded by the ERDF (5/20-4/23, Gaudl, Palomino, Clarke, £4.1M to UoP). Thirdly, we complement our income from large collaborative projects and postgraduate training networks (see below), by standard grants from EPSRC, BBSRC and other sources. Examples are the EPSRC BABEL project to study brain-inspired cognitive systems (to Cangelosi and Wennekers; £1.2M to UoP); the THRIVE robotics project funded by the US Air Force Office of Science and Research (AFSOR-EOARD, to Cangelosi $555k); or various projects from the Newton Trust (UK) and the European Regional Development Fund to Stoelen to develop agricultural robots (£338k). (The latter partly underpin our Impact Case in Agricultural Robotics.) Fourthly, we received significant funding for postgraduate training networks: 2016-19 EU H2020 Marie Sk?odowska-Curie EID European Industrial Doctorate, €1,345,614 (€819,863 to UoP) “APRIL: Applications of Personal Robotics for Interaction and Learning”. (Cangelosi as Coordinator/PI; Belpaeme, Dahl co-Is). 2016-19 EU H2020 Marie Sk?odowska-Curie ETN, €546,573 “DCOMM: Deictic Communication”. Cangelosi PI, With K Coventry (U. East Anglia) as ETN coordinator, and 8 other partners.) 2015-18 EU H2020 Marie Sk?odowska-Curie ETN, €546,573 “SECURE: Safety Enables Cooperation in Uncertain Robotic Environments”. (Cangelosi, Metta (UoP & IIT)). 2013-17 EU FP7 Marie Curie Innovative Doctoral Program, €4,077,315 (all to UoP) “COGNOVO: Cognitive Innovation” (PI S. Denham, with Co-Is Cangelosi, Belpaeme, Borisyuk, Wennekers et al.). 2015-18 EU H2020 Marie Sk?odowska-Curie ETN, €547K “QoE-NE: innovative Quality Of Experience management in Emerging mulTimedia services” (Sun, co-I). We further received several prestigious European postgraduate Fellowships. 2016-18 EU FP7 Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship, €183k “CAREER-AID: Controlled Autonomous Robot for Early diagnosis and Rehabilitation of Autism and Intellectual Disability”. Cangelosi PI, Daniela Conti as Fellow (grant awarded but transferred to Sheffield Hallam University). 2015-17 EU FP7 Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship, €195k “DOROTHY: Donating Robots a Theory of Mind”. Belpaeme PI, Lamaignan as Fellow. 2014-16 EU FP7 Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship, €231k “DeCoRo: Developmental Contextdriven Robot learning”. Cangelosi PI, Stoelen as Fellow. 2013-15 EU FP7 Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship, €221k “ORATOR: Integrating Object Recognition and ActiOn for action sentence production and comprehension in a developmental humanoid Robot”. Cangelosi PI, Beata Grzyb as Fellow. These fellowships were all highly successful: Stoelen and Lemaignan received lecturer posts at UoP afterwards. Stoelen now shares his post in Plymouth with an Associate Professor post in Norway. Lemaignan, Conti and Grzyb are currently research associates at Bristol University, Sheffield Hallam University and UCL, respectively.  Page 14  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Finally, we use enterprise-focused grants for research development and proof-of-concept innovative projects. These can be third-stream projects that generate applied research funded by external, non-academic partners of the University of Plymouth Enterprise Limited. Examples are a Honda European Graduate Network funded by Honda (Offenburg, Germany) for £93,176, 2017-20, a UoP grant to set-up Fieldwork Robotics Ltd, 2017 a spin-out company led by Stoelen (£50k), and proof-of-concept funding to Stoelen and Howard. 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society Our research strategy puts strong emphasis on national and international collaborations to maximise impact. We contribute extensively to our research communities through the full spectrum of available measures like conference organisation and chairing, editorial and reviewing activity, or membership of learned societies and outreach activities. Co-authorship is a direct measure of our intensive collaborations and their impact on visibility. Table 2 shows that almost all our publications (98.1%) present collaborative work of which almost two thirds (62%) are with international co-authors. The vast majority (96.5%) are outputs from academic collaborations. With a field-weighted citation index (FCWI) of 1.71 they are cited more than 70% more frequently than an average paper in our field. Table 2: Collaboration data derived from all publications of the unit (1121 publications) Collaboration type % Scholarly Citations FWCI Data from Scopus (up to 10 Nov 20) outputs outputs International collaboration 61.6 691 8207 1.91 National collaboration only 15.4 173 1064 1.34 Institutional collaboration only 21 236 2155 1.67 Single authorship (no collaboration) 1.9 21 30 0.32 Academic-corporate collaboration 3.5 39 324 2.25 No academic-corporate collaboration 96.5 1082 11132 1.73 International Collaboration  As the previous section details we have led major collaborative and agenda-setting programmes in all our target areas of research. Cangelosi and Belpaeme attracted many large international grants in robotics (APRIL, MoveCare, CAREER-AID, SECURE, THRIVE, among others) that firmly established our world-leading role in humanoid cognitive robotics and social and health-care robotics. Belpaeme and Gaudl will develop this line of research in the future in collaboration with the Centre for Health Technology (Jones; EPIC, EPIC2 projects) (https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/centre-for-health-technology). Members of CSCAN (Shiaeles, Furnell, Clarke, and Stengel) collaborated with national experts on the EPSRC project “Identifying and Modelling Victim, Business, Regulatory and Malware Behaviours in a Changing Cyberthreat Landscape” and also, internationally, on the H2020 FORESIGHT project: “Advanced cyber-security simulation platform for preparedness training in heterogeneous IoT, industrial and defense ecosystems”. These projects aim at tackling the ever growing Cybercrime threat in the UK and worldwide. The CYBER-Ship lab is a national capability that engages researchers from throughout the University (Jones and Tam from the Maritime Cyberthreat Research group, members of CSCAN, Psychology, Maritime Law and Economics, Navigation and Maritime Science) as Page 15  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) well as 18 commercial partners. It is accessible by national and international experts and is actively seeking further collaborations with academic and industry partners. Few locations worldwide bring together a similarly broad infrastructure and expertise to explore maritime cyber-security. We therefore expect this new group to flourish and gain extensive visibility and strong impact quickly. Much of our research is interdisciplinary, especially, in Computational Neuroscience (Wennekers, Borisyuk, Howard, Merrison-Hort) or the growing fields of Health and Social Robotics see EPIC/EPIC2 (Gaudl, Belpaeme); ORE (Walker, Gianni) as well as autonomous systems (collaborations with Mechanical Engineering). Here we benefit from the university’s institute structure: marine (ORE), health (health and social robotics) and sustainability (agritech). Howard recently contributed to highly influential research on Morality and Creativity with colleagues in the School of Psychology. These studies would not have been possible without his expert input on haptic and 3D visualisation technologies, and his expertise in human Psychophysics. Borisyuk further led high impact interdisciplinary research on central pattern generators in collaboration with Roberts and Soffe (UWE Bristol). This work is important for future bio-inspired embodied robots with small (tadpole) brains and featured on the front page of the Journal of Neuroscience. Wennekers collaborated on largescale human-like neural models with Cangelosi (then UoP), Pulvermueller (Freie Universitaet Berlin), Garagnani (Goldsmiths) and Furber (University of Manchester) to understand language learning in humans. This work aimed at neural language models for humanoid robots that make use of the SpiNNaker architecture to reach real-time performance. This led to new spiking neuron algorithms and implementations on iCub, iCub simulator and SpiNNaker boards. Belpaeme and Gaudl further collaborated locally with the eHealth research group on robots in health care (EPIC and EPIC2 grants). This collaboration is central to one of our impact cases. A focus of high-impact activity are the Marie Curie international training networks we run or contributed to: APRIL, DCOMM, SECURE and COGNOVO. These allowed us to dive into research 
topics at the frontier of science and steer the respective research agendas. Many of our postgraduate students and fellows on these projects have chosen a career in science, where they can contribute to their fields further. In particular, COGNOVO (https://cognovo.eu/) was a highly interdisciplinary, extremely successful EU Innovative Training Network established at UoP that aimed at exploring Creativity and Behavioural Change from the widest variety of perspectives. 13 EU fellows and 12 PhD students (additionally funded by UoP) collectively engaged on this endeavour. Members form UoA11 (Borisyuk, Wennekers, Cangelosi, Wennekers, Howard, Bugmann) supervised 6 students on Robotics and Computational Neuroscience topics, and were on the supervisory teams of 8 others. The ITN finished in 2017 and was exceptionally successful. Several of the fellows have permanent academic posts already. We have also developed strong interdisciplinary collaborations with colleagues in the Marine and Health Institutes. Howard, Borisyuk, Wennekers, Cangelosi and Belpaeme work and publish frequently with members of the School of Psychology. Belpaeme, Gaudl, Clarke and Palomino cooperate closely with the research group for eHealth. Culverhouse, Jones and Tam have strong links to the Marine Institute, and members of the Autonomous Marine Systems Group (which are submitted to UoA12) are associated members of the CRNS. The interdisciplinary nature of our research is visible in many of our submitted outputs.  Page 16  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Staff in UoA11 are actively engaged in Conference Organisation and Chairing. Wennekers organised and chaired MSBDy17 (with Achermann, Zurich, and Olbrich, Leipzig) “Brain dynamics on multiple scales, their dynamics, and integrated approaches (June 2017, sponsored with 18kEUR by the Max Planck Institute for Complex Systems. Cangelosi and Belpaeme acted as general and co-Chair of the IEEE ICDL-EPIROB conferences 2017 in Lisbon and 2018 in Tokyo. They also co-directed the “APRIL Summer School”, 10-13 July 2016, Cefalù, Italy. Belpaeme was further co-director (with Bram Vanderborght, Vrije Universiteit Brussel) and Thill (University of Plymouth / Radboud University, Netherlands) of the 2nd and 3rd International Summer Schools on Social Human-Robot Interaction, 2017, in Portugal and 2015, in Finland. Furnell has co-chaired five instances of the International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy (ICISSP) and Sun was symposium co-chair for Communication Software, Services and Multimedia Applications (CSSMA) at IEEE ICC 2019, Shanghai, China and at IEEE ICC 2014, Sidney, Australia. Walker has chaired the annual Visualisation in Genetic and Evolutionary Computation workshop (held at ACM’s GECCO) since 2012. In addition, staff were co-organising Chairs / PC chairs of over 20 other conferences and workshops and served on the programme committees of another 60+ workshops and conferences within the reporting period. Members of the unit gave 10+ keynote lectures at international conferences. Examples include Furnell: “Cybersecurity Illiteracy”, 18th Annual Security Conference, Las Vegas, USA, 30 April 2019. Clarke: “Is Digital Forensics a Necessity for Organisations?”, University of Nevada (Reno), May 2019. Belpaeme: Keynote at Joint IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning and on Epigenetic Robotics 2018, Tokyo, Japan. Cangelosi: Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning Workshop. Rome, 2017. This is in addition to more than 30 other invited presentations at conferences and 100+ further invited academic talks. Journal editorships: CRNS staff contribute as editors-in-chief and associate editors to more than 20 journals, including major IEEE and open access journals. A selection of these are Editor-in-Chief of “Interaction Studies“ (Cangelosi) and “IEEE Transactions in Autonomous Mental Development” (Cangelosi), “Information and Computer Security” (Furnell), associate editorship of “Neural Networks“ (Borisyuk), “PLOS one” (Wennekers), “Ecological Informatics“ (Culverhouse), “Frontiers Neuroinformatics” (Wennekers), Frontiers Computational Neuroscience (Wennekers), Entertainment Computing (Belpaeme), International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems (Belpaeme), Computers and Security (Clarke, Furnell), The Computer Journal (Oxford)(Furnell). All staff engage in regular peerreview of journal articles. Our staff serve their communities by taking multiple roles in disciplinary associations and learned societies: Jones serves as chair of UKCRC Membership Committee and BCS Appeals Committee. He is also member of UKCRC Exec and the BCS Academy Board. Furnell is member of the annual Wilkes Award Committee for The Computer Journal. He was lead contributor to the design of academic degree certification programmes for the National Cyber Security Centre, as well as a contributor to the international Cybersecurity Curricula Guidelines from the ACM/IEEE Joint Task Force. As an Associate of the Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford, Furnell contributed to two working groups (Building Cyber Skills and Leadership and Controlling Risks Through Technology and Processes) within the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre. Sun served as Vice-Chair for the IEEE Communications Society, Multimedia Communications Technical Committee; Walker on the IEEE Task force on Many Objective Optimization; and Gaudl as general committee member and editor for the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (AISB). Page 17  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Several colleagues are IEEE Senior or Regular Members (Jones, Belpaeme, Clarke, Cangelosi, Stoelen, Sun); Members of the ACM (Furnell, Jones, Stoelen); Fellows of the British Computing Society (Jones, Clarke, Furnell, Cangelosi); a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (Jones) or members of more than ten other recognised organisations. Four are members of the EPSRC peer review college (Jones, Belpaeme, Cangelosi, Borisyuk), three review for the BBSRC (Howard, Borisyuk, Wennekers) and all staff act as regular referees of other national, EU and overseas projects by international funding agencies. Senior members served extensively as external PhD examiners (Belpaeme, Borisyuk, Cangelosi, Clarke, Furnell, Sun, Wennekers). Wennekers was external reviewer for the foundation of an MSc in Computational Cognitive Neuroscience at Goldsmiths. Community and Outreach Examples of wider contributions to the economy and society includes Furnell’s contribution to the development of the Chartered Institute of Information Security new skills framework for information security professionals. The framework led to a change in work-based practice in the public and private sector (eg BT, AXA, GSK). The National Technical Authority at GCHQ has used it to underpin its Certified Cyber Professional Scheme.  Stoelen is collaborating closely with local groups in Devon and Cornwall to develop agrirobotic harvesting systems. On a wider scale he provides open access to his low-cost Gummi Arm technology (https://mstoelen.github.io/GummiArm/). Stuart pushed forward a project with University hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust on data visualisation in the clinical environment, and Wennekers worked with the Westcountry River Trust to implement a data collection and visualisation system for their extended sensor networks. Members of the unit are active in outreach, with school visits and several activities brought regularly to events such as open days, showcases and science festivals. For example, Belpaeme, Cangelosi and Gaudl use nao-robots for social robotics and health-care demonstrations and Gaudl evolved gaming, VR and multi-media applications to feature at public events. The School hosts the Computing at Schools Regional Centre for the South West, which aims at establishing Computing firmly in all primary and secondary schools (https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/about-us/university-structure/faculties/science-engineering/casregional-centre-south-west) We are also actively engaged in the British Computer Science Society where Palomino chairs the South West branch (https://www.bcs.org/membership/member-communities/south-westbranch/south-west-branch-committee/)  Finally, various research projects attracted a large amount of press interest, notably our impact cases about social robotics and agritech (Stoelen & Howard; Cangelosi, Belpaeme & Gaudl).

"Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Institution: University of Sheffield Unit of Assessment: B-11 Computer Science and Informatics 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy 1.1 Overview The Department of Computer Science is committed to advancing the theoretical foundations of computer science and to achieving impact through close collaboration with end users. Our focus on interdisciplinary research is distinctive: much of our most impactful work arises from research at the boundaries between computer science and other disciplines. We play a central role in the University research environment, providing leadership for six interdisciplinary centres and flagship institutes. Our vision is to address major challenges within four themes: speech and language, healthcare technologies, bioinspired machine intelligence, and dependable and secure systems. Our strategy is to develop a large cohort of excellent researchers that exhibit breadth as well as depth, enabling us to forge international collaborations that advance the discipline and create real-world impact. Work across our four themes spans novel contributions to the theoretical foundations of the discipline through to the translation of our research into applications used by thousands of people. Research activity is supported by substantial investment in computing facilities and infrastructure, including a planned £10.5m refurbishment of our accommodation. Key achievements since REF2014 include: ?  Growth in academic staff from 33 to 55, with a 100% increase in the number of female academics and 67% growth in international academic staff.  ?  Publications in top computer science (e.g. ACM, IEEE, TCS, NeurIPS) and interdisciplinary (e.g. Nature Communications, Nature Neuroscience, PNAS) venues.  ?  £32.5m in research income, a 73% increase from REF2014.  ?  Growth in industrial income from £875k to £2.1m, including two new industry-funded research centres supported by £1.4m to date.  ?  New groups in Algorithms and Security of Advanced Systems, the latter with a £1.2m strategic investment from the University.  ?  Growth in the PhD student population of 20%, with sustainability ensured through the award of a £5.2m UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) award, further supported by £2.2m in industry-funded studentships.  ?  A successful impact pipeline that has produced three spin-out companies, informed UNESCO’s COVID-19 response and added $120m to the value of a major Silicon Valley speech technology company.  We take great pride in being a collegial, supportive research community, one in which equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) are core values. The Department was awarded an Athena SWAN Silver award in 2016. Through an ongoing action plan, we are committed to advancing EDI in the discipline through local, national, and international initiatives. Page 1  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) 1.2 Unit structure, research strategy and progress towards REF2014 objectives Our research strategy focuses on key questions and major challenges associated with our four themes. Research in each theme is supported by a cluster of research groups, each of which is led by a senior academic (Figure 1). Every theme addresses both fundamental research and engineering applications. Academic membership in these research groups is not exclusive; many researchers contribute to the activities of more than one group, and groups contribute to more than one theme. The Department sits within the Faculty of Engineering. All groups are supported by specialist laboratory facilities, interdisciplinary facilities provided by the Faculty, and University-level highperformance computing (HPC). Our Research Software Engineering (RSE) group provides expertise on HPC within the Department and across the whole University. In REF2014 we set out an ambitious plan for expansion, aiming to develop areas of existing strength (speech and language technologies, machine learning (ML), healthcare technologies) and grow our expertise in algorithms. Implementation of our REF2014 plans was further informed by a strategic review in 2015/16, which recommended that new groups be established in Algorithms and Security of Advanced Systems. The outcome over the assessment period has been a significant strengthening of our research across all four themes, as outlined below.  Figure 1: Key strategic themes, structure, and collaborations  Speech and language A major challenge for spoken language technology (SLT) is to develop conversational agents that can engage in human-like dialogues: this requires a deep understanding of spoken language behaviour and robustness to the presence of multiple talkers. Explainability, trustworthiness and elimination of bias in SLT systems are also fundamental concerns. We address these challenges through one of the strongest concentrations of SLT researchers in academia worldwide, comprising 18 academics from our Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech and Hearing (SPandH) groups (8 professors, 9 lecturers/ senior lecturers, 1 fellow). The cluster is unique in its ability to conduct research across a broad spectrum, from computational models of language and human hearing, to commercially deployed automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text engineering systems.  Page 2  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Our success in addressing the challenges of this theme is illustrated by influential publications. Work on noise-robust ASR includes an approach to using multiple microphones cited in Google patents (Hain ICASSP), and papers on the CHiME challenges for distant microphone ASR that have received over 1,000 citations (Barker, Computer Speech & Language). Papers published in top NLP venues cover social media analysis (Aletras, ACL), metaphor identification (Lin, ACL), idiomaticity detection (Villavicencio, ACL) and the evaluation of neural sentence encoders (Barrault, EMNLP). The latter has been cited over 1100 times and inspired the widely used GLUE benchmark. A study on predicting judicial decisions (Aletras, PeerJ CS) has received over 300 citations since 2016. This theme was supported by funding awards totalling £16.3m. Additionally, we have ensured future sustainability through a £5.2m UKRI CDT award in Speech and Language Technologies, matched by £2.2m of industry sponsorship from Apple, Amazon, 3M and others. Three impact case studies have emerged from this theme. The Silicon Valley company VoiceBase established a centre to support Hain’s world-leading research on ASR (£500k p.a.). Machine translation research has been supported by a prestigious £1.2m ERC starting grant (Specia) and has informed technology used by Facebook and Microsoft. Text engineering for social media analysis (Bontcheva) has been an outstanding success, attracting nearly £4m of grant funding and being used by Buzzfeed and Nesta. Moving forward, a particular focus will be on SLT for low-resource languages and sparse data domains that are poorly served by current deep learning methods. We plan to establish a centre of excellence in NLP for computational social science. Healthcare technologies Research in this theme is driven by the complexity of the clinical setting, aligned with challenges in harnessing technology to deliver healthcare more effectively. We focus on computational models as tools to identify causal relationships in disease mechanisms. Key challenges include maximising the information gained from images and measurements, developing personalised models to improve diagnosis and target therapy, monitoring disease progression via data analytics, and translating these tools into routine use. This theme is primarily supported by our Organisations, Information and Knowledge (OAK) and Complex Systems Modelling (CSM) groups, with input from the ML group. Fifteen academics contribute to the theme (5 professors, 10 lecturers/ senior lecturers). It is further supported by a network of clinical and interdisciplinary collaborations provided by Insigneo (the Institute for in silico Medicine), the Centre for Assistive Technology and Connected Healthcare (CATCH), the Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN) and the flagship Neuroscience and Healthy Lifespan Institutes. Contributions to basic science and optimising therapy include insight into the mechanisms of wound healing from multiscale models of cells and tissue (Walker, J Roy Soc Interface), novel personalised models of the heart (Clayton, Phil Trans Roy Soc A), and models and risk stratification of intracranial aneurysms (Watton, Biomech and Model Mechanobiol). Examples of research translation include the integration of Watton’s aneurysm growth model into the ITIS (Switzerland) SIM4LIFE software and clinical testing of a speech analytics system for the detection of cognitive decline (Christensen). Data analytics approaches have been used to understand patient trajectories through the NHS (PathAnalyse, funded by the Health Foundation and deployed in Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, Villa-Uriol) and to quantify physical activity in the community setting via a smartphone app (Large-Scale Data case study, over 1m downloads by 2019). Page 3  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Grants totalling £5m were secured from funders including BBSRC, British Heart Foundation, the EU, NIHR, the Health Foundation, Rosetrees Trust, Wellcome Trust, Amazon and EPSRC. Many grants are collaborations between academic and clinical partners in the UK and internationally, as well as industrial partners, e.g. we are partners in the €10.3m PRIMAGE Horizon 2020 project. Our future research focus will be on leveraging our expertise in ML in areas such as uncertainty quantification for personalised disease models and medical image analysis. Bioinspired machine intelligence Research is driven by the design of energy-efficient algorithms that learn from fewer data, and yield solutions that are interpretable and explainable. We tackle these challenges through fundamental research mainly inspired by biological organisms. This theme is supported by 14 academics (3 professors, 11 lecturers/ senior lecturers) across the ML, CSM, Visual Computing and Algorithms groups and makes a substantial contribution to Sheffield Robotics (Prescott is the Director). Research spans fundamental theory on graph networks, genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning to applications, e.g. in cognitive robotics. Highlights include work on graph clustering (Peng, STOC) described as “breakthrough” by ACM Fellow Sanjeev Khanna, work on graph convolutional networks (Lu, CIKM) that outperforms stateof-the-art models, and a novel energy-based formulation of learning for spiking neural networks (Gilra, ICML; e-Life). Models of insect navigation and learning (Marshall, Mangan, Vasilaki, PLOS Computational Biology) and their applications in robotics have provided the intellectual foundation for a spin-out company, Opteran. Alvarez’s work on data-efficient latent force models for reinforcement learning (IEEE TAC) led to EPSRC funding on “one-shot learning”. Oliveto and Sudholt’s runtime analysis of genetic algorithms won a GECCO’14 best paper award. The theme is supported by grants totalling £8.6m, including funding from Amazon (Lu) and Google (Vasilaki). Examples include the £1.2m ActiveAI EPSRC Centre-to-Centre grant (Mangan), which establishes a long-term research partnership with leading teams in Australia, and the £2m Brain on Boards programme grant (Marshall). Vasilaki has secured three grants for her work on neuromorphic engineering, forging links with the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (EPSRC and Leverhulme, £1.8m). Oliveto obtained an EPSRC Early Career Fellowship (£1.2m). Prescott collaborates internationally via the Human Brain Project (£0.7m). A particular focus of future research will be the development of explainable AI. Gilra and Vasilaki recently secured a CHIST-ERA grant addressing causal explanations in reinforcement learning, and Alvarez is developing methods for learning cause-effect models from large datasets. Lu will focus on interpretable ML for data-scarce domains. We will expand our work on bioinspired robotic vision (Sun), supported by additional staff recruitment. Dependable and secure systems Research is driven by the challenge of developing systems that are demonstrably dependable and secure. Key problems relate to concurrent systems, for which correctness is tightly coupled to architecture. Hybrid systems, which combine discrete and continuous data, provide particular challenges for smart manufacturing and autonomous systems. Ensuring privacy in modern advanced systems is also an important issue. The theme is supported by 18 staff (5 professors, 12 lecturers/ senior lecturers, 1 fellow) across the Algorithms, Testing, Verification and Security groups, including four of the most senior UK  Page 4  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) academics working in the field (Derrick, Hierons, Struth, Clark). Research income was £6.5m, including grants from the EPSRC, EU, Dstl, Google and Facebook. Highlights include significant contributions to concurrency theory, including completeness/decidability for concurrent Kleene algebras (Struth, LIPIcs), decidability/complexity for distributed testing (Hierons, IEEE ToC), and notions of correctness and complexity for weak memory (Derrick, ACM TOCL). We developed authentication protocols (Gope, IEEE TIFS), ciphers (Kavun, CRYPTO), and access control methods (Kaaniche, IEEE TCC) for resource-constrained architectures and novel techniques in distributed testing (Hierons, ACM TOSEM) and verification in the presence of transactional memory (Derrick, several EPSRC projects in collaboration with ARM). We addressed compositionality to enable scalability (Hierons, EPSRC RoboTest) and the testing of highly concurrent Erlang code (Derrick, EU PROWESS). We advanced automation through work on automated reasoning (Struth, FAOC), the theoretical basis for model checking (Ordyniak, FOCS) and theorem-provers applied to verify the security of real-world applications (Popescu, POPL). We use metaheuristics such as genetic algorithms (e.g., Clark, Journal Syst. Soft.; McMinn, ACM TOSEM) and are one of the few groups to provide theoretical results regarding the effectiveness of these techniques (e.g. Oliveto, TCS). Future plans include exploring the quantitative verification and testing of probabilistic systems, supported by the UKRI Verifiability Node and EPSRC RoboTest project (Hierons). We will further develop verification and testing techniques for transactional and non-volatile memory (Derrick). EPSRC-funded work on causal inference (Walkinshaw, CiTCOM) provides a starting point for addressing large-scale systems. Finally, we will investigate how AI can be exploited for defence and attack (Clark, Gope and Kaaniche). 1.3 Approach to supporting interdisciplinary research Through our strategic themes, we carry out research in areas that are interdisciplinary by nature, and seek impact through partnerships with other domains. Speech and Language draws on phonetics, linguistics, psychophysics and engineering but also contributes to these disciplines (e.g. computational models of hearing, NLP methods in corpus linguistics). Healthcare Technology and Bioinspired Machine Intelligence are entirely interdisciplinary themes, in which close collaboration with other research areas (particularly medicine and biological sciences) is key. Approximately 60% of our outputs and 35% of our grants involve collaborations with departments such as Biological Sciences, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology, Physics, and Law. We identify key interdisciplinary areas based on research strength and sustainability and support them through the following mechanisms: Strategic leadership of interdisciplinary University institutes and centres. We hold leadership positions in: Insigneo (Clayton); Sheffield Robotics (Prescott); and CATCH (Christensen) as well as in three of the four University Flagship Research Institutes - Neuroscience (Vasilaki, Gilra), Healthy Lifespan (Villavicencio, Villa-Uriol), Sustainable Food (Cunningham). These facilitate our involvement in large collaborative grants, e.g. the €15m SANO centre for personalised medicine, and lead to interdisciplinary 
outputs (e.g. Current Biology), and position papers in influential journals (e.g. Nature Food). We nurture future leaders of interdisciplinary research through early engagement with leadership (e.g. Gilra, Villa-Uriol and Christensen held roles in institutes as lecturers), supported by schemes such as Sheffield Leader (Section 2.3). Appointments in interdisciplinary areas. We recruit researchers with demonstrable ability to work across disciplinary boundaries. Appointments have cemented our links with Neuroscience (Alvarez, Gilra, Mangan, Wang), Neurology (Christensen), the NHS (Lanfranchi, Villa-Uriol), Page 5  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Cardiology (Lu) and Psychology (Prescott). Outcomes include interdisciplinary publications in top venues (e.g. Nature Neuroscience) and £3.15m in collaborative grants. Internal funding to support interdisciplinary research. We invested £800k in interdisciplinary PhD studentships, and co-supervise students with 11 other departments. We organise events that catalyse interdisciplinary collaborations, e.g. an ML workshop for the Faculty of Science. Resulting outcomes include papers co-authored by PhD students in prestigious outlets (e.g. Nature Machine Intelligence) and new collaborations with the Department of Chemistry. We also fund infrastructure for interdisciplinary research (Section 3). Research software engineering (RSE). We support a rapidly growing RSE group by underwriting 6 posts, an investment of £90k since 2014. The group underpins excellence in research software across the University: in 2019/20, it supported 28 grants, with a total value exceeding £9m. In turn, this leads to interdisciplinary collaborations: Richmond (head of RSE) holds interdisciplinary grants totalling £1.4m, including projects on bone disease and tuberculosis vaccine development. Our future strategy includes investment in these successful mechanisms and capitalising on our strategic involvement in interdisciplinary institutes, which will benefit from the University’s recent commitment to invest £13.7m in four flagship research institutes. We have leadership positions in three of these and are forging links with the fourth (Energy) via our new appointment Gope. 1.4 Impact strategy, support mechanisms and outcomes Our impact strategy promotes early engagement with end users of our research across each of our four strategic themes to ensure that impact is embedded from project conception to dissemination. The identification and development of impact opportunities are supported by an impact champion (Cunningham), Faculty and University research support services, and the following mechanisms: Joint appointments. These bridge us with key targets for translating research. Lanfranchi has a joint appointment with the NHS, securing more than £400k in health-related grants in the last two years. Law’s appointment with the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) led to the involvement of the AMRC in a UKRI TAS Verifiability Node. Visiting academic appointments. Six industry figures facilitate connections that support research impact. Collaboration with visiting academic Chakravarthy (Dstl) led to the foundation of a new University Technology Centre for AI in Defence and Security. Consultancy. Generous consulting and shared IP arrangements encourage staff to undertake consultancy that can lead to larger impact opportunities. Since REF2014, consultancy income exceeded £1.4m, involving 13 staff and 39 partners. These partners include SMEs such as Elephant Gin (Law) and Alchemy Machines (Aletras) and large companies such as Samsung (Ragni). The Large-Scale Data impact case study arose from consultancy contracts with Public Health England (to develop the “Active 10” app) and JustGiving. We proactively identify impactful research and support it via reduced workloads and impact sabbaticals. Professional knowledge exchange colleagues assist industry engagement, both in the Faculty (2 FTE) and in a central impact and knowledge exchange team (13.2 FTE). From the latter, we received Impact Accelerator Account, HEIF and Commercialisation of IP funds of £311k in the assessment period. Our RSE group is deployed to accelerate impact, supporting, e.g. our case study Combatting Disinformation by rapid delivery of an online COVID-19 disinformation dashboard.  Page 6  Unit-level environment template (REF5b)  Figure 2: Impact pipeline Our successful impact strategy is apparent from the quality and diversity of our selected case studies, which range from influential research informing policymakers (Banning LAWS, Combating Disinformation) to speech and language research that underpins the technology of VoiceBase, Facebook and Microsoft (Automatic Voice Recognition, Machine Translation), and research on analysing data at massive scales, which has impacted hundreds of thousands of people (LargeScale Data). Our successful impact pipeline is evidenced by many projects at various stages of translation, e.g. working with South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, we used the open-source GATE text engineering technology developed in our speech and language theme to find a link between symptoms of schizophrenia described in a patient’s clinical records and the likelihood of that patient being admitted to a hospital. In our bioinspired machine intelligence theme, fundamental research on the visual system of the honeybee has been translated via Opteran (Marshall). The company is pioneering bioinspired silicon-based solutions for computer vision and autonomous decision making and has raised £2.1m in seed funding. Existing case studies and new projects in our impact pipeline will provide the starting point for developing our future impact agenda. Our centres funded by VoiceBase and Dstl will be crucibles for translational research, further feeding our impact pipeline. Our impactful work on misinformation will be supported by additional academic appointments. 1.5 Open research and research integrity Research integrity is a fundamental component of research excellence. We uphold principles of honesty, responsibility, fairness and accountability, supported by commitment from the institution, our staff and postgraduate research (PGR) students. Our strategy for developing open research and research integrity is based around the following three pillars: Developing a culture of research integrity. We adopt an approach to research that is underpinned by honesty and transparency and supported by rigorous methods and reporting principles. Training is a key factor in achieving this. All PGR students and new staff complete a course on Professional Behaviour and Ethical Conduct. We run an annual seminar on peer review, targeted at PGR students and postdoctoral research assistants (PDRAs). All staff and PGR students complete online training in unconscious bias and protecting research data. We ensure that informed, auditable oversight of research integrity occurs in practice. Ethics, data governance and research methodology are considered at all PGR progression/review points and in probationary staff reviews. We maintain a panel of trained ethics reviewers, supported by a bespoke online ethics approval system. Audits of our ethical approvals are undertaken by the University Research Ethics Committee. Declarations of interest are systematically reviewed and Page 7  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) updated annually. Faculty approval is required for the appointment of PGR examiners, with due regard to appropriate competence and independence. Finally, we seek to establish a culture in which concerns about research integrity can be raised without fear of reprisal. A procedure for whistleblowing is outlined (see REF5a); however, we emphasise that honesty is paramount. Support for open access (OA). We ensure that publicly funded research is accessible to the public, industry, and the wider academic community, and we adhere to University-wide principles of OA. To ensure maximum discoverability of our research, we aim to put all outputs in White Rose Research Online, our shared repository with Leeds and York (green route). The 1,463 outputs deposited over the assessment period were downloaded over 99,000 times. This is our preferred route, ensuring equity in publishing opportunities regardless of available funding; we also publish outputs in fully OA journals, supported by a Departmental fund, or hybrid where required for funder compliance. In addition, staff increasingly submit papers to preprint services such as arXiv to ensure timely dissemination of research findings. Twenty staff have editorial roles in journals that support open research. Support for open data, open methods and open-source software. This support is the core of reproducibility, being intimately linked to the culture of research integrity we seek. We publish software and datasets to the community through our institutional data repository, ORDA. The speech and language theme has been particularly active in sharing open data, including the Lombard Grid, an audiovisual speech corpus, and CHiME, a series of ASR challenges. Our RSE group supports a doctoral training module on software methodologies and tools, underpinning our commitment to the reproducibility of results. We promote open training to the community, e.g. the annual Gaussian Process Summer School (Lawrence, Alvarez, Smith) is a beacon of the open approach to research training. The related GPy open-source framework for Gaussian Processes is distributed through GitHub, with 431 users and 64 contributors. Going forward, our strategy is to recognise and promote methodological excellence within our research, e.g. by leveraging our capacity in RSE to support and educate staff and PGR students in open research software. We will develop short courses in open data and software for research locally and then make them available to the whole University as a beacon activity; Derrick’s experience as chair of the University OA Advisory Group will facilitate this. We will also promote awareness of the ethical requirements and practices of other disciplines. Lanfranchi is our ethics lead and has a joint position with the NHS; she is well positioned to advise on research integrity within the healthcare technologies theme, which increasingly involves clinical collaboration. 1.6 Strategic priorities for the next five years Our ongoing strategy is to capitalise on our excellence and to grow our investment around our four key themes. Priorities in the next five years are as follows: Further develop collaborations in our strategic themes. Collaborations allow us to better understand challenges and act as vehicles for a broad range of impact. These collaborations will be facilitated by further growing our academic staff to 73 to enable theme, institute and end-user collaborations while maintaining a balanced growth across the four themes. Our first priority is to increase our capacity in machine vision, which will provide new opportunities for interaction with Insigneo, CATCH and Sheffield Robotics. Collaborations benefit from Sheffield’s commitment to invest £13.7m in four flagship research institutes, all of which we are linked to. Finally, we will enhance collaborations with the AMRC and High Value Manufacturing Catapult through our dependable and secure systems theme.  Page 8  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Exploit and contribute to wider infrastructure and services. Significant opportunities for leveraging infrastructure in areas of Sheffield’s strengths are the £43m Industry 4.0 investment in the AMRC and the HPC provision at the Faculty, University and national levels. IT infrastructure will benefit from a £10m University investment. A key aim will be to grow our HPC infrastructure at the scale necessary to support our research in ML. To address this, we will seek collaborations with other academic institutions and commercial cloud computing providers. Revitalise and exploit our physical infrastructure. We plan to be in extended and refurbished accommodation by the end of 2022, enabled by University investment of £10.5m. We will use this opportunity to re-equip our groups, stimulate cross-group research and enhance the PGR student environment. Our refurbished building will offer an improved environment for knowledge exchange and external engagement, facilitating our future impact strategy, which stresses early and close engagement with business, the public and the third sector.  2. People 2.1 Overview Our REF2014 plans have led to significant, strategic growth within our key themes. The Department now has 55 academic staff, 2 academic fellows, 72 researchers; among those 2 academic fellows, 6 University teachers, 39 professional support staff, and 86 PGR students of which 53 are Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs). Each theme is supported by a mixture of senior research leaders, mid-career staff and early-career researchers (ECRs) with an excellent trajectory. We take great pride in fostering a friendly, collegial and nurturing research environment. Our approach to staffing and recruitment is informed by deeply held EDI values, recognised through a Silver Athena SWAN award. The University is in the top 100 of the Sunday Times Best Employers List, is a Top 5% Stonewall employer and maintains an HR Excellence in Research Award and Disability Confident accreditation. 2.2 Staffing and recruitment strategy Our staffing and recruitment strategy ensures that we have the breadth and depth of research excellence needed to address our research themes. Challenges have been to appoint outstanding individuals in competitive areas (e.g. cybersecurity, ML) and to attract senior academics to establish new groups and strengthen the leadership of existing groups.  Page 9  Unit-level environment template (REF5b)  Figure 3: People, staffing and recruitment strategy We achieve these aims in two ways. Firstly, we develop a distinctive five-year support package for ECRs, in the form of internally-funded proleptic fellowships. These offer guaranteed progression to an open-ended academic position, subject to meeting standard probation requirements. Secondly, we support new lecturers and professors with an attractive package including internally-funded PGR studentships and a reduced teaching load for 2-3 years. This strategy has been successful in attracting outstanding talent. Over the assessment period, we appointed 2 fellows (1 female), 17 lecturers (5 female), 7 senior lecturers (1 female) and four professors (1 female). These contribute to the excellence of our research themes as follows: Speech and language. Research in multilinguality and cognitively motivated NLP was supported by the appointment of Villavicencio to a personal chair. Three senior lecturers (Goetze, Barrault, Lin) bring expertise in deep learning methods. Lectureship appointments Ragni and Aletras have progressed rapidly, the latter winning £508k in grant income since appointment. We deployed an internally-funded fellowship to recruit Scarton in the competitive area of machine translation. She has already won a major grant (EPSRC £446k). Healthcare technologies. We recruited Lanfranchi to a joint position with the NHS: she has secured £547k in grants since appointment, many with clinical partners. Villa-Uriol and Yang bring physiological modelling and machine learning expertise, cementing our links with Insigneo. Wang is a joint appointment with Neuroscience and SITraN, bringing expertise in bioinformatics. Christensen has developed extensive clinical collaborations through work on the assessment of neurodegenerative disorders (Journal of Neurology) and secured an EU Marie Sk?odowska-Curie Training Network (TAPAS). Bioinspired machine intelligence. Prescott was recruited to a chair to grow links with Sheffield Robotics, where he is the Director. Lecturers Mangan and Sun bring expertise in bioinspired robotics and machine vision. Research in core ML methods was strengthened through Alvarez and Lu, who have earned £839k between them in grants, with both securing an EPSRC New Investigator Award. Expertise in graph clustering was strengthened by Peng, who publishes in the competitive SODA conference. Gilra’s work on recurrent spiking neural networks (eLife) cements our links with the flagship Neuroscience 
Institute. A proleptic fellowship was used to attract Smith, whose work on ML methods for pollution modelling is likely to become a future impact case study. Dependable and secure systems. Clark was recruited to lead our new Security group, supported by strategic University investment of £1.2m. The group now comprises 5 academics, 3 PDRAs and 10 PGR students. Appointments in the Security group bring expertise in cryptographic algorithms (Kavun, Kaaniche), information flow security (Popescu) and internet-of-things (IoT) security (Gope). Our expertise in model checking was bolstered by Ordyniak, who publishes in top venues (e.g. Algorithmica). Leadership in testing was supported through the chair appointment of Hierons; Page 10  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) with new senior lecturer Walkinshaw he has won an EPSRC grant on causal inference for testing computational models. Capacity in verification was increased by Beohar and Dimitrova, the latter having expertise in hybrid systems and potential links with the AMRC. All Category A staff are on open-ended contracts. We offer open-ended contracts to researchers on fixed-term projects wherever appropriate, taking account of longer-term strategy and plans. Currently 35% of researchers are on open-ended contracts (up from 24% in the last period). Going forward, a plan has been developed with Faculty approval to grow our academic staff to 73 within 6 years. We will recruit a chair and two further lecturers in machine vision, supporting our bioinspired machine intelligence and healthcare technologies themes. The dependable and secure systems theme will be strengthened by a chair and two lectureships in distributed systems and an additional lectureship in security. An internally-funded fellowship will support the pipeline of researchers working on social media analysis in the speech and language theme. 2.3 Staff development and support Our strategy is to provide support that enables high performance, agility, leadership, and intellectual and professional development. During the assessment period, a particular focus has been to support the progression of fellows to academic positions and to ensure that new appointees and ECRs become well-embedded in the unit and rapidly progress. The University’s Academic Career Pathways (ACP) framework provides a structure for academic staff progression from early career to professorship. Research and impact are explicitly recognised within the ACP framework, with appropriate expectations set to enable achievement to be rewarded in terms of progression. All staff have an annual review meeting that focuses on career planning and identifies ongoing training needs. Strong staff engagement with this process exists in the Department (e.g. 97% of staff completed a review in 2019). Supporting fellowships. Faculty professional services provide support by arranging mock interview panels, and workloads are adjusted for those developing fellowship applications. In the assessment period, seven of our staff held fellowships, three of which were ECRs (see below). Bontcheva won an EPSRC Career Acceleration Fellowship while working part-time, and Specia was awarded an ERC starting grant. In both cases, the fellowships supported work that led to an impact case study. Marshall was awarded an ERC Consolidator grant and Clark held a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award. Supporting the development of ECRs and PDRAs. We proactively mentor our ECRs to ensure their retention and career progression, with close involvement of the Head of Department (HoD). The success of this approach is exemplified by Oliveto and Richmond, who were initially supported by Sheffield Vice-Chancellor Fellowships. Both were subsequently appointed to senior lecturer and won EPSRC Early Career and RSE Fellowships respectively. Croucher won a second RSE Fellowship and progressed to Head of Research Computing at the University of Leeds. An extensive range of development modules is available to PDRAs, including courses on entrepreneurship, research management, academic writing and media training. A professor and EPSRC panel chair (Clark) runs a proposal-writing training module for ECRs and PDRAs. Implementing the Concordat to support the career development of researchers. We have mapped our activities against the Concordat and implement its principles through an induction programme, annual reviews and away days for researchers. The latter covers topics such as industry engagement, frequently with an invited speaker. The “Think Ahead” development  Page 11  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) programme, coordinated by a dedicated member of the University’s professional services team, further promotes employment and professional development opportunities. Supporting probationary staff. Probationary staff have a reduced teaching load for three years (set as 50%, 70%, and 90% of normal load). New appointees have a mentor and devise a probation plan with the HoD. They meet monthly with the HoD/Deputy HoD during the probation period. This close mentoring approach is successful: all 10 staff who completed probation exceeded their grant income target of £130k, with a mean grant income of £344k. Half of these staff completed probation a year early. Developing future leaders. Research groups are typically led by a professor. In some cases group heads are new senior appointments (Clark, Hierons), but in most cases future leaders are developed from existing staff (e.g. Bontcheva, Hain), with a succession pipeline supported by departmental mentors or institutional programmes such as Sheffield Leader. Twenty-six staff participated in these programmes (11 female, 15 male) and have gone on to assume major leadership roles within the Department (e.g. group heads, HoD, Director of Research) and in the wider University (Christensen is Faculty Director of EDI; Derrick is Vice President for the Faculty of Science). 2.4 Support and reward for research and impact Research and impact are rewarded through the ACP framework, which sets out transparent expectations to achieve career progression. In the assessment period 23 staff were promoted, including 6 to personal chairs (3 women), which reflects the high quality of our staff, our robust processes for supporting career progression, and our readiness to recognise and reward achievement in research as well as broader contributions in leadership, professional standing and wider engagement. Sabbaticals allow one semester of leave after seven and are allocated according to a rolling schedule, looking several years ahead. Part-time staff take study leave on a pro-rata basis. Notable outcomes of 15 sabbaticals in the assessment period include the following: McMinn developed a new relationship with Facebook, leading to a £41k grant on search-based testing; Sudholt published four journal papers (Artificial Intelligence, Algorithmica, IEEE TEC) and four conference papers (GECCO); Prescott visited the Sage Centre for the Study of the Mind at the University of California Santa Barbara as Distinguished Fellow, leading to a co-authored article (Trends in Neuroscience); and Hain visited the Nagoya Institute of Technology as Visiting Professor, leading to a student exchange and collaboration on a grant proposal. We also fund shorter research visits that are likely to lead to high-quality outputs, e.g. Struth’s visit to Macquarie University and Data61 in Sydney led to two collaborative papers on quantitative information flow. We keep teaching and administrative loads in balance through a workload allocation model so that time for research and impact is protected. We also support research through spending on teaching-specialist staff; since 2014, we have appointed 6 university teachers (two were funded through a £1m Institute of Coding grant) and increased spending on GTAs from £31k in 2014/15 to £90k in 2019/20. 2.5 Support for postgraduate research students Our strategy is to create a diverse community of PGR students with a broad range of specialist skills and intellectual perspectives. We aim to attract the brightest PGR students from the UK and internationally, driving recruitment with internally-funded scholarships (£3m over the assessment period) and through our CDT, which will sponsor 60 PGRs over 2019-2027. We attract diverse Page 12  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) candidates by advertising widely and support self-funded applicants where possible (e.g. via partial fee scholarships). Our success is evidenced by a diverse cohort (13% EU and 59% international representing 38 countries) and PGRs with first-authored papers in top journals (e.g. Paetzold, Journal of AI Research; Mirheidari, Computer Speech & Language; Osuna, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation). Supporting progression All PGRs are assigned a primary supervisor, an independent advisor from the same research group and a panel chair from a different group. We supplement University-required annual reviews with six monthly panel meetings, enabling clear and timely oversight of progress. For students registering in 2015/16, 89% submitted within their four-year time limit. A 2019 Postgraduate Research Experience survey showed high overall satisfaction (82%), with positive responses for supervision (86%), skills development (89%) and resources (85%). Skills training and preparation for future careers All PGR students complete training courses in research integrity, teamwork and presentation skills and must formulate a data management plan. Each student has a dedicated workspace and desktop computer and an allowance of £1,500 for conference participation. Outcomes include numerous prizes for presentations at international conferences (e.g. Ge, International Symposium on Search-Based Software Engineering 2017; Naith, International Conference on Crowd Science and Engineering 2018). We build connections with potential employers through industry talks, engagement with visiting professors (e.g. Leidner, Thomson-Reuters), collaboration with our CDT sponsors (e.g. Amazon, NHS Digital) and internships (e.g. Apple, Microsoft, Baidu, Google, Electronic Arts). Success is evidenced by the breadth of professional careers that our PGRs pursue after graduation, including postdoctoral positions (e.g. Loweimi, Edinburgh; Armstrong, Cambridge; Rabehaja, Macquarie) and fellowships (Richmond, EPSRC RSE Fellowship). Several have progressed to lectureships, e.g. Usman (UET Lahore), Roberts (KCL), Alharbi (King Saud University). Derczynski and Augenstein hold professorships at the University of Copenhagen, with Augenstein leading the NLP group (line managing 44 people). Our PGRs have taken up significant roles in tech startups (e.g. Mokharam, EmoTech) and have been employed by industry leaders (e.g. Gomes, Amazon; Doulaty, Facebook). 2.6 Equality, diversity, and inclusion Our strategy is to ensure that our practices in recruitment, staff support and career development fully harness a diverse pool of talent, enabling us to advance our research themes. We implement this strategy by embedding EDI throughout departmental processes. All staff undertake unconscious bias training; a gender balance is ensured in all committees and appointment panels; and search committees seek applicants from underrepresented groups. The University has an active Disability Staff Network. Positive responses in the 2018 University Staff Survey confirm that the Department recognises and values diversity and difference (97%). Over the assessment period, we appointed eight women to academic (lecturing or fellowship) positions. Addressing gender equality. Our active engagement with Athena SWAN has led to both Bronze (2013) and a Silver (2016) awards. Through our action plan, mentoring by the HoD and the University’s peer mentoring scheme, we have been successful in improving gender equality in our pipeline from ECR to professor. We had 23 promotions, of which 6 were female. We increased the number of female professors from zero in 2014 to four over the assessment period, three of whom Page 13  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) were promoted from within the Department. Currently women account for 36% of lecturers, 22% of senior lecturers/readers/advanced fellows and 17% of professors. Female academics have obtained £8.6m in external funding since 2014, generating 27% of our research income. This statistic is impressive, given that three women were recent appointments (<1y) and that, prior to 2016, none were professors. Female senior leaders include our Director of Research, two research group heads, the Faculty Director of EDI and other leaders in the wider University. Eliminating discrimination and promoting diversity. We are a proudly multicultural department with 32 international academic staff of which 22 were appointed during the assessment period. Firmly embedding EDI principles in our recruitment processes has led to an increased proportion of BAME staff; with 25% of staff self-reporting as BAME. We are committed to supporting our LGBTQ+ staff and PGRs, as evidenced by the University’s Stonewall Top 100 Employers position for seven years running. We actively support different lifestyles, for example we have flexible arrangements for a number of academics with partners in different cities. In our most recent staff survey, 96% of staff agreed that they could talk openly with their line manager about flexible working. We offer targeted help to staff and PGRs with protected characteristics (e.g. changes in working pattern to accommodate disabilities). Support for international staff includes flexibility with overseas working, which was particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Supporting mental health and neurodiversity. The Faculty has a wellbeing officer who provides expert one-to-one support and signposting to students, including PGRs. We plan to further buttress this support with a dedicated wellbeing officer for the Department. We are liaising with IBM on their industry-leading work in neurodiversity to gain greater insight into practices for recruiting and supporting neurodiverse staff; this has informed our ongoing Athena SWAN action plan. Parental leave and childcare. In addition to statutory maternity, adoption and shared parental leave, staff on leave can elect to perform up to 10 days of paid work without loss of statutory pay (‘keeping-in-touch’ days). Since 2014, 12 staff members have taken parental leave. All staff taking parental leave remained in employment with the Department after 18 months. One staff member received an award of £10k through the University’s Women Academic Returners’ Programme (WARP), which provides financial support for women to mitigate the impact of extended leave on research. Equality and diversity issues in the preparation of this REF submission. In accordance with the University Code of Practice, four principles were applied throughout all stages of our submission: transparency, consistency, accountability and inclusivity. Staff with a leading role in our REF submission (3 males, one female) have undertaken unconscious bias training; output selection was overseen by a female academic. The selection of outputs was guided by anonymous internal and external reviewers. Subsequent validation showed that we had not introduced significant gender bias in the selection of outputs. 40% of our impact case studies are led by women (20% of academic staff are women).  3. Income, infrastructure and facilities 3.1 Overview We ensure that our four research themes are well supported through income capture, infrastructure provision and access to facilities. A particular focus has been to diversify our support base by increasing our UKRI and industry funding. This diversification reflects opportunities: the Page 14  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) synergy between UKRI funding priorities (Industrial Strategy, Made Smarter), industry demand for our research (in areas such as SLT), and growth in our research strengths and ambitions. Diversification was also a response to the challenge of uncertainty regarding UK participation in EU research schemes. The key outcomes are an increase in grant income from £18.8m in the last period to £32.5m and more than doubling industry income from £875k to £2.1m. Our underlying strategy has 
been multi-pronged. We have actively recruited in areas of strategic importance, making professorial appointments to enhance leadership and appointments to fill gaps in our expertise (see Section 2.2). This has ensured sustainability of funding across our research themes. We have sought and achieved positions of leadership in major grants (e.g. EPSRC programme grants, fellowships, coordination of EU grants). Time for research and impact is protected through investment in teaching-specialist posts, sabbaticals and funded short-term study leave (see Section 2.4). Appointing staff with interdisciplinary profiles has created opportunities for new funding streams (e.g. Rosetrees Trust). Our interdisciplinary collaborations allow us to leverage a wide range of facilities across the University. We leverage and contribute to HPC provision across the University and through national initiatives such as JADE. This reflects the increasing importance of HPC to the ML interests of almost all of our research groups. 3.2 Income Research grant capture. Our research income increased from £18.8m (REF2014) to £32.5m, with UK, EU, and industry funding in each of our four strategic themes. We have been highly successful in obtaining EU funding; this reflects the international and multidisciplinary nature of our work and the close alignment of our strengths with EU and UK priorities. We grew our EU funding from less than £10m (REF2014) to £15.4m. We collaborated with leading European scientists on 39 EUfunded projects, involving 177 universities, 92 companies and 85 charities, and coordinated 5 FP7/Horizon 2020 grants (PROWESS, WeSenseIT, Pheme, CONTESSA, SETA). We achieved diversification of our grant capture: 56% of our funding was from non-EU sources, an increase from 49%. UKRI funding increased from £6.5m to £12.4m. Income from charities was £717k, including grants from the British Heart Foundation, Wellcome Trust, Rosetrees Trust and Alzheimer’s Society. 62% of our submitted papers came from funded projects, as did four of our impact case studies. New staff have been responsible for £6.8m in external funding and approximately 50% of our outputs. Large grant leadership. Leadership in all four of our themes is demonstrated by major single grant awards, reflecting the excellence of senior research leaders within the groups. In the bioinspired machine intelligence theme Marshall leads a collaborative EPSRC programme grant, Brains on Board: (£4.8m, £2.2m to Sheffield). This was supported by a lecturer appointment (Mangan). Outputs from the grant include interdisciplinary papers in top journals (e.g. Proceedings of the Royal Society Series B) and a spin-out company (Opteran). In the dependable and secure systems theme, Clark leads the £4.9m Research England IoT innovation project PITCH-IN, a collaboration with Oxford, Cambridge, and Newcastle. In the speech and language theme, Hain held the EPSRC Natural Speech Technology programme grant, which laid the foundation for our CDT and VoiceBase centre. Fellowships. Fellowship income totalled £5.1m. An ERC Starting Grant to Specia (£1.2m) led to an impact case study on machine translation, which underpins technology used by Facebook and Microsoft. A £1.2m ERC Consolidator Grant to Marshall funded his research on bioinspired robotics, leading to a programme grant (see above) and first-authored interdisciplinary publications Page 15  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) in competitive outlets, e.g. eLife. Richmond and Croucher won 2 of the 7 awards in the first round of the EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellowships. Richmond has since established a team of 12 people (see Section 3.3); Croucher progressed to Head of Research Computing at the University of Leeds. Oliveto won an EPSRC Early Career Fellowship for his work on the rigorous runtime analysis of bioinspired computing (£1.3m). Over the assessment period, he published over 50 papers in, e.g. Theoretical Computer Science and IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation. New appointees. We support new appointees with dedicated grant writing workshops. EPSRC First Grant/New Investigator Awards were obtained by Vlachos (non-monotonic incremental language processing), Alvarez (one-shot learning of human motion), Lu (sparse features for fMRI analysis) and Ordyniak (parameterized algorithms). Industry income. This increased from £875k (REF2014) to £2.1m. Notable achievements include two new industry-funded centres, with funding totalling £1.4m. The Silicon Valley company VoiceBase funds a centre employing 12 people to support Hain’s research in ASR. A Dstl-funded University Technology Centre for AI in Defence and Security was established in 2020. Staff have been successful in obtaining research funding from tech companies, a total of £510k in the assessment period from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, e.g. a Google award to Barker supported his work on the influential series of CHiME ASR challenges. PGR income. Our reputation for research excellence makes us an attractive environment for PGR students; since 2014 our PGR base has expanded by 25%. We have strategically invested our own funds in PGR scholarships to support new staff and major grants; since 2014 we spent ~£3m and have committed £3.35m over the next 5 years. We were awarded a UKRI CDT in Speech and Language Technologies, which will train 60 PGRs over 2019-2027. This award provided leverage for investment in staff within our speech and language theme, with the subsequent appointment of Barrault, Goetze, Lin, Ragni, Scarton and Villavicencio. The CDT has significantly grown our industry connections, leading to collaborative funding from Amazon Research, Google, Microsoft Research, NHS Digital and others. We participate in the EU Marie Sk?odowska-Curie ITN TAPAS (Christensen, Barker, £454k) and NeuTouch (Prescott, £248k). By diversifying our support base and building connections across disciplines and with external partners, we are well positioned to respond quickly and flexibly to changing priorities and opportunities. A recent illustration is Lu’s success in winning a highly competitive US National Institutes for Health AI in Health and Care Award in 2020 (< 8% success rate, £504k) that brought together our ML expertise with clinical expertise from Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. 3.3 Infrastructure and facilities Our growth in staff numbers is matched by investment in infrastructure and facilities, ensuring that our themes are well supported to generate excellent research and significant impact. Key investments during the assessment period are highlighted below. High-performance computing. Our strategy is both to fully exploit the extensive HPC facilities provided by the University and to further contribute to them. We maintain a server room for specialist equipment but increasingly we are investing in additional nodes for the central HPC clusters Bessemer, ShARC and Iceberg. Together, these provide 350 worker nodes, 6500 CPU cores, 49 TB of RAM, 60 GPUs and 1425 TB of fast network storage. 313 members of our staff and PGR students have accounts for these HPC facilities. We supplemented University investment in HPC facilities with £480k of equipment, in addition to £800k spent on large-memory nodes and GPUs for ML. Recognising the increasing importance of deep learning, particularly for our speech Page 16  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) and language and bioinspired machine intelligence themes, we provide a significant number of state-of-the-art GPUs to individuals (eight in 2019) and our CDT (three 6GB NVIDIA Titan cards). We were the first UK university to purchase an NVIDIA DGX-1, an accelerated platform for deep learning. We are part of a consortium that has access to the JADE Tier 2 GPU cluster, designed for the needs of machine learning and related data science applications; this also supports work on machine translation. Going forward, a University £10m plan to deliver a new Research IT and Innovation Strategy has been agreed upon. Sheffield Robotics. Our close collaboration with Sheffield Robotics and links to the AMRC provides access to a wide range of specialised equipment and facilities. In addition to the 200m 2 Sheffield Robotics lab, a human-robot interaction lab (17m2), a motion capture lab (60m2), two hangars (400m2) and a workshop (40m2) are available. Equipment includes Kilobots (Marshall on the DIODE project); KUKA iiwa (Law and Gaizauskas, EPSRC Network Plus Connected Everything project); Jaguar 4x4 rovers, Griffon dynamics Octocopters, and DJI Phantom 4 (Law, EPSRC UK-RAS Field Robotics Challenge 2016); iCub (Prescott, Horizon 2020 WYSIWYD and Cyberselves projects); 3D printers (Marshall, Green Brain and Brains on Board projects) and dedicated technical support (2 FTE). Sheffield Robotics has won over £1.5m in EPSRC capital awards since 2014, and we supported it with an additional £0.9m for staff and equipment. Research software engineering. Our RSE group, one of the largest in the UK, grew from 2 FTE in 2016 to 11 FTE. The group largely sustains itself on grant income, but together with central IT services we underwrite posts to offer staff job security and so to ensure retention. They have been instrumental in producing software usable by stakeholders, e.g. a web service for fact-checking used by journalists was developed (Rumour Analysis Service (RAS) project, funded by the Google Digital News Initiative and WeVerify, Bontcheva), and they are critical to our reproducibility strategy (see Section 1.5). The team contributes widely to the national RSE agenda through guidance for reproducible research (via The Turing Way with ATI), national training for HPC (via Software Sustainability Institute fellowships and HPC carpentry), and leadership (via a Future RSE Leaders workshop and an RSE Leaders panel) and includes two of the twelve members of the Board of Trustees of the Society of Research Software Engineering. Facilities for specific research clusters. We have an apiary and a beekeeper to support the Brains on Board project and invested £50k to start the Security group (specialist forensics equipment, oscilloscopes, and experimental robotics). Involvement in University interdisciplinary research centres and flagship institutes gives access to specialised equipment, such as the CATCH “home lab”, an instrumented living space for supporting research on disabilities, e.g. dementia (Christensen). Lanfranchi’s joint appointment with the NHS has resulted in access to clinical facilities, feeding into over £600k of grant funding. Wang’s work is supported by secure computing facilities provided by Genomics England, leading to two grants (over £900k). SANO (see Section 1.3) provides HPC infrastructure to support computational medicine research. Technical and research support staff. Our technicians (12 FTE) support software and hardware technologies, including a dedicated server room. Since 2014, the expansion of our robotics activities within the bioinspired machine intelligence theme necessitated the appointment of a dedicated safety officer. The Faculty has established a pipeline of technical staff through the Engineering Apprenticeship Scheme, in which apprentices rotate around departments before settling into an open-ended position. The result is technical staff with well-rounded expertise, able to provide software and hardware support. We invested £29k in the training of technical support staff. Our research support team (8 FTE) assists the development of funding bids and grant management and identifies potential industrial collaborators. A further 6 FTE provide professional support to specific projects and the CDT. Page 17  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) The Diamond. Completed in 2015 at a cost of £81m (19,500m 2), the Diamond is the largest capital investment ever made by the University. Within this, the MindSphere Lounge provides a collaboration and IoT demonstration space for the University, Siemens and local business (Clark is the academic lead). The iForge maker space provides 3D printing, CNC and laser cutting and is available to all staff and PGRs (e.g. for the construction of bespoke hardware). Research laboratories. Our main office space and research laboratories are in the Regent Court building. We strategically maintain offices in multidisciplinary spaces, which encourages collaboration and provides additional space for equipment (e.g., Sheffield Robotics). A key part of our ongoing infrastructure strategy is to refurbish Regent Court (an estimated cost of £10.5m plus £1.5m for a student innovation hub). The overall space will increase by 35% and meeting space will increase by over 50%. The refurbishment will enhance our facilities for collaborative research (e.g. informal working spaces, a large social area, breakout rooms) and opportunities for engagement with the end users of our research (e.g. demonstration spaces).  4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society 4.1 Overview Our strategy to facilitate collaborations and widespread impact depends on the creation of an environment for excellent research: we ensure that our researchers have the necessary time and support to develop significant collaborations at the international, national and regional levels. The previous sections outlined our pipeline for translating fundamental research into real-world impact (Section 1.4) and described our staffing strategy (Section 2) and underpinning infrastructure investment (Section 3.3). Here, we highlight the major outcomes arising from our strategy and actions. 4.2 Research collaboration Much of our most impactful work arises from sustained, often interdisciplinary, collaborations. 84% of research outputs produced during the assessment period involved collaborators from a different discipline or university. 83 research grants involved an industrial partner or another university. International collaboration. International best-with-best collaborative projects facilitate worldleading research. We collaborated on 44 EU projects and coordinated 5 EU FP7/Horizon 2020 grants totalling over £3.3M. We also collaborate with a range of international companies and have received nearly £2M in funding from them. Examples include VoiceBase, BioGen, Amazon and Microsoft. Collaborations are also sustained through our involvement in international centres. ActiveAI brings together world leaders in entomology, neuroscience, biorobotic modelling and computational neuroscience to develop new algorithms for robust and efficient learning for autonomous robotics. SANO (see Section 1.3) is funded by the EU and Polish government and Clayton is on the Scientific Committee. We also support individual collaborations: our internationally leading research has attracted 99 visitors from 26 countries. Visits of our staff to international collaborators include world-class institutions such as the University of Pittsburgh, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, ETH Zürich, University of Zürich, KTH Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm, and Yale University.  Page 18  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Approximately 60% of our submitted outputs had an international co-author, with 40% externally funded and 20% stemming from individual collaborations . National and regional collaboration. Since 2014, our staff held grants of £15.2m with 40 UK academic collaborators. Of our papers, 12% have been co-authored with other UK universities. Programme grants have been effective at establishing long-term collaborations with national academic partners, e.g. Natural Speech Technology (Hain, EPSRC £6.2m) supported a collaboration with Edinburgh and Cambridge, leading to significant growth in our speech and language theme and ultimately to our CDT. Within the Sheffield Region our work with Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust led to further NHS collaborations (Sheffield Children's Hospital, Rotherham General Hospital). Outcomes include technologies for remote healthcare monitoring and the early detection of conditions, e.g. diabetic retinopathy, funded by 7 projects totalling £331k (Lanfranchi, Villa-Uriol). We collaborate with Sheffield mobility-tracking company The Floow, funded by the EU SETA project (Ciravegna, £1.03m), and HumanStudio on virtual/augmented reality for 
digital heritage (Maddock, funded by the AHRC and leading to a Festival of the Mind exhibit; see below). 4.3 Engagement with key research users, beneficiaries, and audiences Our strategy is to identify key research users aligned with our four research themes and engage with them through collaborative research projects, technology centres, joint appointments, spin-out companies, our CDT and our industrial advisory board (IAB). Key users include IT companies and the industrial sector, the NHS, education, and policymakers. Our impact pipeline (Section 1.4) plays a crucial role in sustaining long-term, productive engagements with key research users. Within the speech and language theme, engagement has been driven by strong commercial demand for our SLT research. Our ASR technology adds $120m to the value of VoiceBase (Automatic Voice Recognition impact case study). Automatic translations in Facebook are underpinned by our research on quality assessment for machine translation (Machine Translation case study). ZOO Digital joined our IAB and is now co-developing technology for dubbing video content through an Innovate UK grant (MAUDIE, £314k). Initially attracted by the CDT, Huawei are now supporting SLT research with a further £700k in funding. The healthcare technologies theme engages with key research users (NHS, Public Health England) through research projects, some of which have been catalysed through a joint appointment with Sheffield Teaching Hospitals (Lanfranchi). Ciravegna’s work on mobility tracking led to an impact case study and a spin-out company, Aeqora Ltd. Brown’s work with SME Passion for Life Healthcare (PFLH) demonstrates how engagement with research users enriches our research. A discussion with PFLH suggested that methods developed in our Department could be applied to the acoustic monitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorders, which led to our first Knowledge Transfer Partnership award and a growing research stream on the health applications of acoustic monitoring, supported by a PFLH-funded PGR studentship and a subsequent Innovate UK grant (BRAHMS, £243k). In the bioinspired machine intelligence theme, a key beneficiary of Prescott’s research is the education sector: his work on bioinspired robot control is embedded in the MiRo robot, marketed through Consequential Robotics Ltd. Approximately 400 units have been sold to schools and universities. Working with researchers in Uganda, Smith has contributed ML expertise to a project that has rolled out 70 low-cost pollution monitoring stations across Kampala, engaging schools, businesses, civil society organisations and citizens. Page 19  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) In the dependable and secure systems theme a key audience is the advanced manufacturing community. A joint appointment with the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (Law) led to the involvement of AMRC in a TAS Verifiability Node (Hierons), engagement in the security of manufacturing robotics (AAIP CSI:Cobot, Clark) and a jointly funded PhD studentship (Popescu). The University has a dedicated account manager for Siemens; this facilitated the opening of the first MindSphere Lounge in Sheffield and the involvement of Siemens in PITCH-IN (see Section 3.2), which addresses IoT across manufacturing, health, energy, and cities. Research on the security of energy systems with our Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, supported by the EPSRC £34m Active Building Construction project, provides further opportunities for stakeholder engagement. 4.4 Wider contributions to the economy and society Strategic investment in Faculty marketing resource (14 FTE) enabled us to raise the profile of our research, leading to influence on policy makers. The high media profile of Bontcheva’s work on fake news led to policy work with the UK government (DCMS report on social media disinformation) and UNESCO (report on COVID-19 disinformation). Our research on the ethics of autonomous weapons has influenced policy within the UN and non-government organisations such as the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots (Banning LAWS impact case study). We achieve broad contributions to the economy through the provision of open-source software. Our GATE text engineering platform is used by Oracle, the BBC, the Press Association and Euromoney. FLAME GPU, a high-performance framework for agent-based modelling, allowed Atkins to achieve an order of magnitude speedup in transport simulations. We expect these advances to be incorporated into the Atkins software used by Highways England. Our research contributes to public health, both internationally and nationally. Clayton has coauthored a research agenda for uncertainty in computational models of cardiac physiology with regulatory scientists from the US Food and Drug Administration. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we were agile and responsive. Working with colleagues from four Chinese universities, Yang published a feasibility study of mitigation and suppression strategies for COVID-19. Richmond led a national development team working on COVID-19 modelling to inform the Royal Society RAMP initiative, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) and the Scottish government. Wang contributed to an effort that sequenced more than 1,000 COVID-19 genome sequences, uploading them to the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium and helping researchers around the world to fight the pandemic. 4.5 Engagement with diverse communities and the public through research We engage citizens in our research through participatory design studies. Examples include an AHRC-funded grant in which a group of cochlear-implanted users co-developed materials for conversational training (Brown) and patient involvement in developing technology to diagnose diabetic retinopathy (Lanfranchi, Villa-Uriol). Close engagement has been established with the arts around AI, visualisation and sound. Brown collaborates with the rock band Reverend and the Makers on AI methods for music generation, supported by HEIF funding of £54k. This collaboration was featured in Sheffield’s Sensoria festival and led to the foundation of a new AI record label. The biennial Festival of the Mind, has engaged approximately 103,000 people to date. We have provided exhibits that engage the public in our robotics research (Prescott), virtual and augmented reality (Maddock), and sentiment analysis  Page 20  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) (Stevenson). Outside of this festival, our staff regularly engage in “pint of science” pub talks and other events, numbering over 70 in the assessment period. We have achieved extensive media engagement over the assessment period. Sharkey is a strong voice in the debate on the ethics of robotics, AI and data science with frequent media contributions including The Guardian, BBC News and the New York Times. Lawrence wrote 11 articles for The Guardian on topics relating to the ethics of AI, open data science and data privacy, shared more than 1500 times via social media and other news outlets. Marshall’s work on biomimetic robotics has engaged audiences in bee behaviour (BBC Click) and drone delivery (Financial Times, Daily Mail). We are passionate about engaging young audiences in our research. We host the UK-RAS School Robotics Competition and offered more than 28 talks and events addressed to a school audience over the assessment period. Prescott’s interdisciplinary research at the boundary of psychology, neuroscience and robotics has engaged children through the Cyberselves Roadshow and Norwich Science Festival. 4.6 Academic leadership and contribution to the sustainability of the discipline Through our strategy, we are well placed to contribute to the sustainability of the discipline. An example is research by Marshall, Vasilaki and Mangan within our bioinspired machine intelligence theme, which promises next-generation AI systems that match insect performance in tasks such as vision and navigation and are power efficient due to having lower computational requirements. We are well placed to develop this theme, with more than £8.9m in funding in place and a route to translation through spin-out Opteran. We actively engage in setting the national agenda. Prescott and Law have co-authored EPSRC UK-RAS white papers on robotics in social care and manufacturing robotics, which have been influential in setting EPSRC priorities. Our robotics activity makes us well prepared to respond to initiatives such as the Made Smarter Review, which identified Sheffield Robotics as a “significant contributor and innovator in global robotics research” (p. 66). By growing our healthcare technologies and dependable and secure systems themes (13 new appointments, see Section 2.2), we have strengthened our research base in areas related to AI and data science for health and to Industry 4.0. This puts us in a strong position to respond to developments in the Industrial Strategy. Our RSE group contributes to the sustainability of the discipline by advocating excellence in research software engineering practice through Richmond’s leadership positions in the Software Sustainability Institute and the Society of Research Software Engineers (see Section 3.3). We provide leadership through international steering groups and advisory boards. Six of our staff hold such roles. For example, Vasilaki advises the AI Centre at the University of Mainz, Germany. Prescott leads a UK-RAS strategic task group on robotics, involving 14 organisations spanning universities, professional societies and the private sector. Lawrence has been a member of the AI Council since it was founded in 2019, an independent expert committee advising the government and high-level leaders of the AI ecosystem. Our staff are active members and leaders of national research networks. We led two EPSRC networks (HealTex, POEMS) and participated in 12 others. Hierons is on the BCS-FACS committee and acts as their representative on the LMS Computer Science Committee. Since 2007, Struth has co-organised the Midlands Graduate School (MGS) in the Foundations of Computing Science, involving the Universities of Sheffield, Leicester, Nottingham, and Birmingham. Moore and Hain make significant contributions to international leadership of the SLT community as board members of the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA). Page 21  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) The Gaussian Process Summer School, run by Lawrence and Alvarez since 2013, has become a staple of PGR training and attracts industry delegates from Amazon, Spotify, JPMorgan, Siemens Gamesa etc. Data Science Africa, an annual series of workshops led by Lawrence and Smith since 2015, has brought together academic and industry experts in data science and ML to deliver research training across Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana and Ethiopia. Our staff make outstanding contributions to international science publications. They hold 20 editorial positions, including 3 Editor-in-Chief positions, e.g. Moore is editor-in-chief of Computer Speech and Language, a key journal in the area of SLT. During the assessment period, 33 of our staff were involved in organising conferences, with 17 acting as Programme Chair. Lawrence was General Chair of the influential NeurIPS conference (2015) and Hain was Technical Chair of the Interspeech conference (2019). 12 of our staff provided leadership as full members of the EPSRC college, three of which are associate members. 9 colleagues sat on grant panels, 4 as chair. Vasilaki and Clark were in the top 6% of college members for participating in peer review activities during the academic year 2017/18. Our staff were external examiners for theses and habilitations in more than 40 institutions across 11 countries, including several prestigious universities (e.g. Sorbonne, Oxford, Cambridge, La Sapienza). The esteem and success of our staff are reflected by the award of many prizes and honours, including 24 keynotes/invited talks and 7 fellowships since REF2014. Hain was elected a Fellow of the ISCA, and Moore is a Distinguished ISCA Lecturer. 14 staff members are members or fellows of professional societies. We are immensely proud of our contributions to computer science, our productive engagement with the end users of our research, and our success in communicating our exciting findings to the public. Since 2014 our growth has delivered an outstanding complement of staff and increased our momentum. With a clear strategic plan, we are well placed to build on our strengths over the next decade and make further significant contributions to the discipline, economy and society.  Page 22  "
"Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Institution: Manchester Metropolitan University Unit of Assessment: B11 Computer Science and Informatics 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy Computer Science research at Manchester Metropolitan University focuses on the real-world applications of technology that are of strategic importance to the UK’s economy and society. Research in artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity aligns to local and national Research and Development (R&D) priorities. Leadership of collaborative initiatives such as the Greater Manchester AI Foundry and Cyber Foundry consortia give us the means to translate our research into economic and commercial impacts. Interdisciplinary research with healthcare, social science and agriculture is rapidly expanding and leading to new developments that are transforming the lives of people across the world. The vitality and sustainability of our research and impact strategy is evidenced by: ? A 100% increase in the number of staff that we are returning to REF 2021. ? A 156% increase in research income from £1.4m in REF 2014 to £3.58m in REF 2021. ? A 113% increase in PhD completions from 16 in REF 2014 to 34 in REF 2021. ? Leadership of the £12m AI Foundry and Cyber Foundry projects. Unit context and structure Research is led by the Centre for Advanced Computational Science (CfACS), one of 14 flagship University Centres for Research and Knowledge Exchange (UCRKE) that were established as part of the University’s ambitious RKE Strategy (see REF 5a). CfACS is quality-focused and innovation-driven. It was created following an assessment of REF 2014 results mapped against areas of growing research excellence that link into the strategic policy landscape including the Industrial Strategy, the Science and Innovation Audit and the national skills agenda. CfACS was approved with a five-year development plan that outlines its management structures, research themes and includes specific funding, publication, citation, impact and staffing strategies. Yonghong Peng (Professor of Artificial Intelligence) and Liangxiu Han (Professor of Computational Science) provide leadership for CfACS, which includes 54 staff (29 full research members with a significant responsibility for research, seven research assistants, seven Knowledge Exchange members who lead on industrial collaboration and ten associate members undertaking research skills development). CfACS currently has 40 PGR students. CfACS is submitting 23 staff to B11 with a further six staff submitted to B12 Engineering. Staff in CfACS are from the Department of Computing and Maths in the Science and Engineering Faculty, one of the UK’s largest providers of research-led teaching in Science and Technology. This submission includes four research themes: Data Science With funding from BBSRC, Royal Society (Newton Advanced Fellowship), British Council and Innovate UK, data science research develops interdisciplinary methods, frameworks, algorithms and systems to enable the extraction of knowledge from the integrative analysis of structured and unstructured data. Our research concerns data science fundamentals and the application of cutting-edge technologies in big data, machine learning/deep learning, AI, natural language processing, governance and security. The impact of our research on social network analysis, data science and AI in Pakistan is in impact case study (reference: ICS 3). Machine Intelligence Machine intelligence research explores the design and application of biologically and linguistically motivated computational paradigms (e.g. conversational agents, natural language Page 1  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) systems, robotics and synthetic biology), computational intelligence, adaptive psychological profiling and human-computer interaction. This group is investigating the ethical, social and legal dimensions of AI through place-based research, working with policy think tanks and local and national government and community stakeholders (ICS 1). Research is funded by the European Commission and Innovate UK. This group provides academic leadership for the GM AI Foundry. Smart Infrastructure Smart infrastructure research focuses on the increasing demands of digital transformation and Industry 4.0. Researchers investigate future network and computation (e.g. 5G and 6G), intelligent transport, connected healthcare, Internet of Things and smart cities. Research leads to the development of tools and methodologies that address challenges in cybersecurity, privacy and computer forensics (ICS 2). Funding comes from industrial partners and Innovate UK. This group provides research leadership for the GM Cyber Foundry. Human-Centred Computing Research focuses on computer image and video analysis, visual computing, augmented/virtual reality, serious games and approaches to empower individuals to take better control of their data. Projects funded by The Royal Society, Cancer Research UK, EPSRC and Innovate UK are concerned with ageing and the use of virtual cosmetics. Interdisciplinary collaboration is leading to new innovations for the detection and amelioration of conditions such as dementia and diabetes, human motion analysis for rehabilitation and serious games for the development and understanding of healthcare issues. Review of plans and objectives from REF2014 REF2014 Objective 1 - Cohesion and Communication Our major objective in 2014 was to strengthen core areas of research and to encourage interdisciplinary activities. CfACS has provided the leadership to achieve this primary objective. We have built critical mass with a large uplift in the volume of staff and outputs, increased quality, and fostered interdisciplinary research. Research cohesion has been strengthened through significant investment and the career development of staff (Section 2). REF2014 Objective 2 – Key themes We have continued to collaborate with high-quality partners in the delivery of technology that is important to the wider economy and society. Research in AI, cybersecurity and big data aligns to ‘future and emerging technologies’ and are important themes in the Government’s R&D ambitions. We have built on strengths in AI and Digital Health with industrial partners, NHS Trusts and healthcare academics. For example, the development of AI-enabled technology for the early detection of diabetic foot ulcers has led to clinical trials expected to deliver significant patient benefits and cost savings (see output reference: 2354). REF2014 Objective 3 – Facilitation We aimed to enhance the quality of research by securing increased levels of external funding and through additional investment in the development of staff. We have achieved increased value of competitive awards over the assessment period winning £5.27m from prestigious funders (EPSRC, STFC, BBSRC, Innovate UK, The Royal Society, Cancer Research UK, H2020). We have also captured significant knowledge exchange funding to transfer research excellence into impact through the award of ERDF funds for the AI Foundry and Cyber Foundry. REF2014 Objective 4 – Public engagement leading to impact We have curated innovative and popular Manchester Science Festival events characterised by a deep understanding of best practice that go well beyond ‘top down’ dissemination formats. In 2018, we developed an immersive theatre experience that put AI ‘on trial’ in the Manchester Police Museum and in 2019; we delivered an event around public attitudes to AI. The results of these activities are informing our forward strategy and the development of initiatives such as the Greater Manchester Charter for Ethical AI.  Page 2  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Strategy for the next ten years Our future strategy aims to enhance research excellence, targets the delivery of global impacts, encourages the development of new areas of intellectual leadership and increases opportunities for commercial development. We will achieve this by supporting a collaborative and inclusive research culture; inspiring support for future research leaders and promoting our world-leading research. Investing in People: We are continuously strengthening our themes by investing in high-quality staff that understand our ethos and are passionate about our mission. We will focus on expanding the equality and diversity of staff and have ambitions to create a gender-balanced research centre. We support our ECRs to become future leaders with continued mentoring and access to development programmes (Section 2). We will expand national and international collaboration linked to strengths in AI, data science, and cyber security. Sustaining excellence: We have an important role in helping businesses to recover from Covid19. The impact of our research on the technological advancement and productivity of SMEs and its link to the future skills agenda will be critical for Greater Manchester. We will develop a ‘Research Institute for Future AI’ that will support the rapid and extensive uptake of AI-enabled technology. Our work will be at the forefront of efforts to promote an ethical approach to AI, and we will embed this approach across disciplines and sectors for the achievement of positive economic and societal impacts. Postgraduate researchers are vital for the sustainability of our research, and we will embed them into the full range of our activities so they are well prepared and equipped for their future careers. Engagement = Impact: Collaboration is vital for our intellectual and financial sustainability and is the key mechanism for delivering economic and societal impact. We anticipate that future funding will go to interdisciplinary projects that can harness the collective knowledge of diverse teams of researchers, industrial partners and communities. The sustainable partnerships that we are developing through our KTP pipeline and large-scale KE initiatives will ensure we play an important role in these emerging opportunities. We will set ambitious targets for the growth of research awards and deliver impacts with a global resonance. Enabling impact CfACS has an Impact and Engagement Manager who helps staff to embed impact across research activities. The Impact Manager works with a group of seven KE members whose focus is on the translation of research into activities that lead to impact. We have an outstanding KTP portfolio supported by an award-winning team. In the assessment period we have secured £2.3m for 17 KTPs that have transformed the productivity of North West SMEs. We have delivered KTPs across all research themes, but they have played a particularly important role as pathway to impact in cybersecurity (see ICS 2). Staff who act as KTP supervisors are rewarded by a 10% workload allocation throughout the duration of their project. Staff are supported by MetroPolis, the University’s research-led think tank (see REF 5a). MetroPolis links our research into policy and provides funding for roundtable events and resources that have helped us to respond to parliamentary enquiries. Internal funding supports impact. Prof Liangxiu Han accessed £30,000 to develop drone technology, which led to field trials to protect food crops from disease in China. Global Challenges Research Funding (GCRF) is used for impact. For example, Dr Nawaz used GCRF to support activities around gender-based violence in Pakistan (see ICS 3). We collaborate closely with NHS Trusts on technology-enabled healthcare. For example, we are working with the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust on AI applications for pathology and with the Salford Royal Foundation Trust on AI for Health and Social Care.  Page 3  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Support for impact will continue after REF 2021. Our Impact and Engagement Manager is already working with staff to make plans for the areas where we want to develop future benefits. Interdisciplinary research Our research structures and strategies encourage staff from different disciplines to undertake collaborative research that would otherwise not be possible. We have a particular strength in research that is at the interface of informatics, health and agritech, and our outputs report many collaborations with healthcare providers and international partners. 30% of the outputs included in the submission are interdisciplinary. Examples include collaboration with ecologists on early warning systems which led to co-funded work with the EPSRC (output 2347), an exploration into the decision-making processes of physiotherapists that led to a large MRC grant on neuromuscular control in children (output 2367) and research on machine learning with psychologists and media professionals. We have won £955,000 from the BBSRC, EPSRC and Innovate UK for international interdisciplinary research in precision agriculture with botanists from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International. Open research Our open access policy is fully compliant with REF requirements and 90% of our in-scope outputs are fully open access compliant (without exceptions). Staff have access to resources for both green and gold open access (see REF 5a). Our institutional repository currently includes 700 items associated with CfACS. Some of the most downloaded work is on traffic-management systems and interdisciplinary collaborations on micro-facial expressions, wrinkles and ageing (over 1,000 downloads). We have UKRI and institutional funding available for article processing charges as well as arrangements with various publishers such as an IEEE Deposit Account. Twenty-two outputs were made immediately available through Gold Open Access resources including impactful research on health informatics and data science. We are fully compliant with the Concordat for Open Research Data, adhere closely to funder policies and seek to make research data accessible and useful to others. Staff share their data using the University repository (see REF 5a), and there are examples of the use of GitHub and other systems to create datasets that have a big impact. For example, in output 2354 we report the creation of the world’s largest dataset for the medical imaging of diabetic foot ulcers used by over 50 institutions from 25 countries. Research Integrity and Ethics Researchers are aware of their responsibilities under the revised Concordat for Research Integrity. Our unit has 3 ethics leads (Prof Han, Dr Yap and Dr Kharel) who represent computer science at the Faculty Research Ethics and Governance Committee. All staff, PGRs and taught students obtain ethical approval before commencing any data collection. Ethical approval is managed through EthOS (see REF 5a). Our Research Ethics and Governance Manager provides training and guidance and has expertise in healthcare-related research. We participate in annual audits of compliance with the institutional expectations around research ethics and governance. We are fortunate to have staff who provide academic leadership for ethics across Computer Science disciplines. In 2019, Prof Crockett co-organised a special session at the IEEE CEC on the Ethics of Computational Intelligence and in 2020, she cochaired a panel and workshop on Ethical AI at IEEE WCCI. 2. People Staffing strategy Our staffing strategy is to attract high-quality researchers and to provide support to enable staff to achieve their full potential. We have invested in staff development and infrastructure. This has underpinned a large growth in critical mass and the number of staff included in our submission has increased by 100% from 11.5 FTE in REF 2014 to 23 FTE in 2021. Our recruitment policy Page 4  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) emphasises the importance of high-quality research, we have workload processes that incentivise and reward good performance, staff development and training initiatives that underline our commitment to the Concordat for the Career Development of Researchers, support for early career researchers, and clear research-based academic pathways and promotion routes. Recruitment We work closely with Heads of Departments and Faculty planners to recruit into areas of expertise. The Director of CfACS and our theme leads are included in recruitment processes to ensure that candidates meet our requirements for both 
quality and ‘fit’. Beyond like-for-like replacement, recruitment is driven by our strategic plans. We have demonstrated world leadership and reputation in specific areas and are using this leverage to attract new talent. The reputation and profile of our research is evidenced by the fact that we attract high quality from an international talent pool and we regularly receive a high volume of applications from around the world. Principles of equality, diversity and inclusion are embedded throughout our recruitment processes. A series of new appointments has underpinned a growth in critical mass in all core areas. Twelve staff were recruited during the assessment period including two professors (Profs Peng and Aspin) and five early career researchers (Cavaliere, Drikvandi, Cunningham, Moretti and Shardlow). Our recruitment strategy in combination with staff development activities (see below) has led to a large increase in overall research capacity, as reflected in our staffing contract profile (Table 1). Professor  Reader  Senior Lecturer  17%  26%  48%  Lecturer, Research Fellow 9%  Table 1: Staff contract level profile  All of our submitted staff are on permanent employment contracts. 22% of our staff are ECRs. Staff development and progression We provide time for colleagues to engage in a minimum of ten days professional development each year. We organise a vibrant programme of ongoing activity including seminars where staff (including ECRs and PGRs) share findings and build collaborative networks. The University is a signatory to the revised Concordat for Career Development of Researchers and has held the EU HR Excellence in Research award for eight years (see REF 5a). Workload allocation All staff with a significant responsibility receive a minimum of 20% of their time allocation for research and are full members of CfACS in line with our approved Code of Practice. Our members have access to internal funds to produce high-quality outputs. They generate research income, supervise PhDs and mentor ECRs. Pay and career progression Colleagues at the top of Grade 8, 9 or 10 (Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Reader) can apply for additional increments to reward excellent research or impact activities. Professors have their pay reviewed annually to provide the flexibility to reward outstanding contributions and retain our top performers. Promotion from Lecturer to Professor is delivered through two Academic Career Pathways: Education, Pedagogy and Citizenship and Research, Knowledge Exchange, Impact, Education and Citizenship. In the assessment period, five staff (22% of our submission) were promoted for their contribution to the production of high-quality outputs and impact. This includes promotions from Reader to Professor for Han, Crockett and Hammoudeh and from Senior Lecturer to Reader for Yap and Kharel. Page 5  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Mentoring and individual research plans Mentoring from research leaders is a key part of our culture. All ECRs are assigned a mentor who can help with their career development. Mentors provide input into the development of individual research plans, publications and grant applications. Information from individual research plans feeds into departmental professional development reviews (PDRs), ensuring that individual research supports departmental strategies and goals. Induction All new staff (including ECRs) undertake an induction program, providing critical knowledge on research conduct, integrity and ethics, the use of RKE Systems, health and safety, procurement and grant management. Institutional training is provided on PhD supervision, postgraduate examining and chairing assessment panels and our equality and diversity policies. All new starters have a reduced workload during their probation period, with a 25% uplift in preparation time for units taught in their first year at the University. Our postdoctoral research associates (PDRA) and KTP associates are members of the UCRKE and engage with seminars, training, funding and other aspects of research culture. They are supported by the PDR system, are allocated mentors and are able to access internal funds to attend conferences and research networking meetings in the same way as other staff. Early career researchers We currently have five ECRS (22% of our overall submission) who were all appointed during the assessment cycle. ECRs are assigned a mentor and complete an individual research plan. We have a number of internal funding schemes and training programmes to support the career development of ECRs including Research Accelerator Grants and RKE Future Leaders. The CfACS management structure includes a dedicated ECR Lead (Prof Crockett) who represents our ECRs at an institutional ECR forum. Prof Crockett organises an annual ECR Showcase to raise the profile of individuals and their research areas. We have an excellent record of supporting ECRs to achieve their full potential, and we see this as a distinctive feature of our culture. For example, Dr Yap was appointed as a lecturer in 2011 and was returned as an ECR in REF 2014. She was promoted to senior lecturer in 2014, and subsequent participation in our Future Leaders scheme helped her to develop larger funding applications such as the Royal Society Industry Fellowship that she was awarded in 2016. This activity led to promotion to Reader in 2017. Dr Yap is now benefitting from the University’s Good to Great programme that is designed for advanced career development and progression. Internal investment and support for professional development We provide staff with access to resources to pursue their ideas and a range of internally funding opportunities for career development. Funding for conferences and events: CfACS members including ECRs and PGRs have access to funding to attend international and national networking events and conferences, to run workshops, to invite external speakers and for knowledge exchange and public engagement activities. Writing Retreats: CfACS organises a biannual writing retreat that has provided staff at all career stages (including ECRs and PGRs) with mutual help and support in developing their personal publication strategies and outputs. Seed funding for the development of new activities: Staff can apply for seed funding (up to £10,000) to develop RKE activities. This has been used variously to purchase equipment, to pay for the costs of visiting research partners, to access external facilities and to support activity that can leverage new funding opportunities and generate high-quality outputs or impact.  Page 6  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Sabbatical arrangements: Staff have access time and resources for sabbaticals that have been used to support high-quality work. For example, Prof Hammoudeh’s sabbatical helped him to develop a strong collaboration with Lab-STICC CNRS, Université De Bretagne Occidentale, France, and Al-Balqa? Applied University, Jordan. This led to the creation of the world's first simulator for smart city digital twin and the production of over 10 publications. Dr Yap used a sabbatical to establish new collaborations with University of Waikato. This led to an EPSRC funding award (EP/N02700/1) and an international workshop in conjunction with MICCAI. Research Accelerator Grants: CfACS staff have been able to access research accelerator grants (see REF 5a) to collect preliminary data for proof of the concept and feasibility. Staff have used the funds to develop capacity in software agents and big data analyses. Global Challenges Research Funding: GCRF is used to develop overseas links with a particular emphasis on support for impact-related activities. Prof Han and Dr Nawaz have used £12,000 of GCRF to extend partnerships around crop disease and gender-based violence in China and Pakistan, respectively. RKE Future Leaders Scheme: CfACS has five RKE Future Leaders (Yap, Latham, Dhajel, Hammoudeh and Kharel) who have benefited from this scheme. Participants are selected through a competitive application process and are given a £5,000 personal development allowance and time allocation to attend the cohort-based learning opportunity. RKE Future Leaders has helped Yap, Hammoudeh and Kharel to secure promotions during the assessment period. Good to Great (G2G): G2G is a competitive development scheme that provides an advanced level of career development for staff who are moving towards the highest levels of academic leadership. Each G2G participant undertakes a needs analysis that informs their learning pathway. They receive internal and external mentorship and are able to access considerable funds for personal and professional development. Dr Yap received £35,000 and teaching relief that enabled her to participate in a series of funding sandpits that led to a successful award from Cancer Research UK and EPSRC. Strategic Opportunities Funding (SOF): SOF provides strategic investment into areas of growth that align with our research ambitions. In 2018, we invested £65,000 for Prof Hammoudeh to produce a prototype system for cybersecurity in the pharmaceutical supply chain (see ICS 2), and Prof Han accessed £30,000 to extend field trials around agritech solutions for crop disease in China (output 2363). Staff exchange mechanisms We have funded mechanisms in place to facilitate staff exchanges including the International Visitor and Research Network Fund that staff use to develop strategic collaborations with overseas partners. Dr Nawaz used the funding for a partnership with the National Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Pakistan, and Dr Dhajel developed links with the University of Rennes around research into smart transportation. We also have a number of visiting professorships which staff use to develop new, externally funded collaborations. For example, Prof Ana Fernández Vilas (University of Vigo) visited staff in the Machine Intelligence group in 2018. This led to the successful award of the €64,600 grant Magos (Secure sMArt Grid using Open Source Intelligence) funded by the Ministerio De Economia, Industria Y Competividad, and joint supervision of a PhD student (output 2352). 2.4 Research students Strategy  Page 7  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Postgraduate Research Students (PGRs) are a vital part of our research community. Our strategy highlights the importance of PGR quality and allocates funding to provide in-depth personalised support to develop our PGRs’ research skills and career development. A proportion of our UCRKE budget is ring-fenced to support PGR activities. In the 2019 Postgraduate Research Environment Survey (PRES) we were in the top quartile for the quality of our supervision, and we have delivered 34 doctoral completions in the assessment period – a 113% increase on REF 2014. Recruitment and funding Eighty students have enrolled with CfACS during the assessment period, and we currently have a diverse community of 40 PGRs recruited from all over the world including China, Saudi, Malaysia, India, Iran, France and Spain. CfACS leads the advertising, recruitment and appointment process to ensure that we attract the right candidates. All PGRs are interviewed by a gender-balanced panel who have completed equality and diversity training including a mandatory module on unconscious bias. Our commitment to individual circumstances is reflected in our PGR community. Fifteen percent of our PGR students have declared a disability, 29% are female and 46% identify as Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME). Studentships are funded from external and internal sources. We have been successful in winning competitive funding such as the Royal Society PhD Studentship for Industry Fellows in 2017 when we were awarded £86,000 for a joint studentship with Image Metrics (output 2339). We were also the first modern University to win the EPSRC Dorothy Hodgson Postgraduate Award to support research on the detection of glaucoma (output 2342). PhD student Dr Haleem was selected as a finalist under the Transforming Society category in the UK ICT pioneer competition 2015 as a result of this project. We have received full funding for studentships from Service Power and matched funding from partners such as Intellicentrics and IBM (output 2385). We are also able to access fully funded Vice-Chancellor Scholarships which are advertised on an annual basis in high-profile global campaigns. Monitoring and support PGRs have a minimum of two academic supervisors including a Director of Studies who supports the development of the student’s research including access to training and career development opportunities. One hundred hours of annual supervision is usually divided between the supervisory team. The SkillsForge system supports student progress and development (see REF 5a). SkillsForge generates automatic reminders about official milestones and records training and actions from supervisory meetings. An Application for Registration takes place after three months (for full-time study) and a Progression Review or Transfer of Registration takes place after 12 months fulltime). All PGRs are expected to submit within four years (pro-rata for PT students). The most recent (2019) results of the Postgraduate Research Experience Survey (PRES) evidence our strong support for PGRs. We were ranked within the top quartile for the quality of supervision in the Computer Science and Informatics category with 100% of respondents reporting that they had regular contact with supervisors that was appropriate for their needs. We have delivered 34 successful doctoral completions during the assessment period. PGR Support and Training All PGRs automatically become members of CfACS, which gives them access to funding, research-focused events and the opportunity to contribute to our collaborative research culture. We run a bi-weekly seminar series that integrates PGRs into our wider mission. A departmental Research Degree Co-ordinator is assigned to provide dedicated support to PGR students. CfACS has a PGR representative (Prof Crockett) who provides an opportunity for the PGR voice to be heard and understood in CfACS meetings.  Page 8  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) We work with the University’s Graduate School to provide training for PGRs (see REF 5a). CfACS hosts away days where we discuss research, career development and practical and theoretical techniques. We encourage PGR students to join professional societies to develop their academic networks, and we signpost opportunities to get involved in public engagement activities, present at conferences, and encourage PGR representation on committees. For example, 10 PhD students were involved in the 2018 and 2019 Manchester Science Festivals supporting our events on AI. PGRs in their second and third year are encouraged to act as mentors to new students. Regular teaching opportunities are available with the process decoupled from the Director of Studies in order to provide a range of academic experience and viewpoints. PGRs have access to lockers, staff common rooms and desks, with the majority using university laptops to allow flexible working. Dr Ryan Cunningham provides a good ‘case study’ of how we support PGRs and how this, in turn, feeds back into our research environment. In 2012, Ryan was awarded a fully funded PhD studentship on a collaborative project with healthcare scientists. Following a successful completion, we were able to offer a research fellowship in Healthcare Science and afterwards a lectureship in Computing. As part of his development, we have been able to provide approximately £20,000 internal funding for Dr Cunningham to attend conferences and to purchase research equipment. In 2019, Ryan’s work with musculoskeletal scientists was awarded £900,000 from the Medical Research Council (output 2383). 2.5 Equality and Diversity We have made progress in improving equality and diversity with a particular emphasis on addressing levels of gender and ethnic representation at senior roles. The equality and diversity of our submitted staff against the total eligible population is included in Table 2 below. Protected characteristic Female Male Declared disability White Total BAME Black Chinese Asian Mixed / Other  % of submitted staff (REF 2021) 17% 83% 0% 61% 39% 0% 13% 17% 9%  % of staff in overall 
eligible population (REF 2021) 13% 87% 5% 73% 27% 0% 7% 15% 5%  Table 2: Equality characteristics of staff against the total eligible population.  Our submission is more representative then the total eligible population with more women included in the return and more staff who identify as BAME. We are more representative than the sector average in terms of ethnicity (39% of staff identify as BAME whereas the average according to the latest HESA data for academic staff in relevant disciplines is 25%). Fifty percent of our professors are female and all of our research themes are led by women. Three out of four professors identify as BAME (compared with nil in REF 2014). We have inspirational leaders of the sector’s approach to equality and diversity. Prof Crockett is Chair of the IEEE Women in Computational Intelligence Committee and Chair of IEEE Task Force on Ethical and Social Implications of Computational Intelligence. In 2019, Prof Crockett was tagged as a “Woman to Watch” (IEEE Women in Engineering Magazine), and in 2020 she was shortlisted as one of the 100 most influential women in UK Technology by Computer Weekly. Dr Latham is currently the Chair of IEEE UK and Ireland Women in Engineering Committee (serving since 2012) and is a committee member of IEEE Women in Computational Intelligence. Page 9  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) CfACS makes a contribution to the University’s equality and diversity agenda. We provided leadership for activities that underpinned the award of Athena SWAN Bronze, and Dr Latham is currently leading a team of academics, technicians and PGRs assembling an application for a departmental submission. Flexible working arrangements Our flexible working procedure facilitates temporary part-time working, compressed hours, job share, and career breaks, combined with a promotions scheme to ensure that colleagues are not disadvantaged by career breaks (see REF 5a). We recognise the effect that equality-related circumstances can have on an individual’s ability to research or on their productivity. Following disclosure of an equality-related issue, we adjust our expectations for the production of research. ECR colleagues have reduced expectations of research outputs. Part-time and fixed-term staff have access to the same support and progression systems as fulltime staff including PDR, career development funds and opportunities. Additional training to gaining academic qualifications is made available to all. Support for staff and research students returning from leave We have policies in place to support staff who are returning from leave or other long-term family absence. We have a generous annual leave allowance with enhanced maternal, paternal and adoption leave in addition to unpaid parental leave if required. We make adjustments for colleagues with caring responsibilities; those with chronic disabilities; and those returning to work after a period of sickness or leave of family-related absence (see REF 5a). The wellbeing of staff and research students All staff have access to the Lifeworks portal for counselling, confidential advice and support for personal issues. Lifeworks is a fully integrated wellbeing platform that provides everyone access to discounts and wellbeing assistance seamlessly via website and a mobile app. Regular meetings with mentors and research theme leaders help us to identify staff that might need to be signposted to support where appropriate. Equality and Diversity and our REF 2021 return In the process of preparing for REF 2021, the Unit of Assessment coordination team aimed to be fair, transparent and inclusive, following the processes set out in our University’s Code of Practice, which we have used to guide decisions around our submission. All colleagues with significant responsibility for research are included in the submission. All staff involved in unit of assessment co-ordination have completed training on ‘Managing Diversity’, ‘Equality and Diversity Essentials’ and ‘Unconscious Bias and REF2021’. All colleagues have been made aware of the processes surrounding requests for a reduction in output expectations, and adjustments in expectations have been made where appropriate. We studied EDAP’s guidance closely and decided that we could manage the cumulative effect on our submission within the revised rules and therefore did not request a reduction in the number of outputs. We have paid particular attention to ensuring that equality and diversity are embedded into the development and preparation of the submission. The Computer Science and Informatics REF2021 Coordination Group featured one male and three female colleagues. We have taken positive steps to share the attribution of outputs: 26% of the outputs are attributed to females despite the fact that there are only 17% female staff in the overall submission. 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities 3.1 Income  Page 10  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Strategic investment in staff including development schemes as well as excellent support from our Research Development Managers has resulted in 51 external research awards totalling £5.26m. We have also secured significant knowledge exchange awards, principally for the GM Cyber Foundry and AI Foundry projects (see below). Research income is £3.58m (156% larger than the £1.4m we reported in REF 2014) with funding from BBSRC, EPSRC, MRC, Royal Society, European Commission, Innovate UK and industrial collaborators. There has been a sustained uplift in external income from 2013/14 (£142,000) to 2019/20 (£863,000). The scope of our funding portfolio remains diverse with 21% from UK Research Councils (EPSRC and BBSRC are our main UKRI sources of income) and 15% from European Funders (see table 3 below). The majority of our income is from UK business, industry and government sources including a large and successful KTP portfolio comprised of 17 projects worth £2.3m.

Prof Han leads this international project in collaboration with industry and academia in UK and China. The project overall funding is £1.5m. CropDoc employs cutting-edge technologies such as IoT, mobile devices, big data and AI to tackle the economic devastation that potato blight causes (output 2363). “iBorderCtrl” European Commission (ID: 700626), €4,501,877, £301,776 to Manchester Metropolitan (2016). Prof Crockett leads our contribution to this EU-funded project with partners from Luxembourg, Greece, Spain, Hungary and Latvia. The project implements faster, more thorough border control for third-country nationals crossing European borders. This project has received a lot of media and political attention (see ICS 1), fuelling international public discourse about the ethics of AI technology. “Populism and Civic Engagement – a fine-grained, dynamic, context-sensitive and forwardlooking response to the negative impacts of populist movements (PaCE)"", European Commission (107402), €2,319,719, €332,063, to Manchester Metropolitan (2019). This is a cross disciplinary project, led by Prof Edmonds (Centre for Policy Modelling, C17) in collaboration with Prof Crockett and Dr David McLean. Project partners include organisations in Iceland, Bulgaria, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Ireland and Finland. “Air Handlers KTP” Innovate UK (KTP 11024) £284,948 (2018) This project led by Dr Kharel is in partnership with Air Handlers who manufacture heating and ventilation systems that are used in hospitals, schools and other public and private settings. The KTP was awarded for the development of a smart, scalable and productive manufacturing system that could expand the existing product range through the adoption of leading-edge mass customisation techniques. “Greater Manchester Cyber Foundry” (ERDF) £6,615,951, £3,000,000 to Manchester Metropolitan (2018) Page 11  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Dr Kharel and Keith Miller (KE member) lead this major collaborative project with the universities of Lancaster, Manchester and Salford to deliver targeted business support to SMEs whilst identifying projects that can harness R&D expertise to develop new products, services and capacity. The Cyber Foundry is driving economic growth and productivity through the application of cyber research and innovation (see ICS 2). “Greater Manchester AI Foundry” (ERDF) £6,876,491, £3,000,000 to Manchester Metropolitan (2020) Keith Miller (KE member) leads this major collaborative project with Profs Aspin and Crockett. From disease detection using deep learning to autonomous vehicle technology using computer vision – the AI Foundry, led by Manchester Metropolitan, harnesses the research across a consortium of four universities (partners are universities of Lancaster, Manchester and Salford) to unlock new products and services in Greater Manchester’s businesses. Strategy for external research income generation Strengthen leadership for developing collaborative larger bids: Engagement with funders and priority-setting exercises led by our Research Development Manager has resulted in an increasingly strategic approach to bidding. Experienced researchers are encouraged to bid more selectively, for larger grants. Robust peer review processes, starting with formal CfACS-level support and scrutiny, enhance the quality of bids and share expertise across the staff team. A careful pathway of mentoring and support for ECRs: We support ECRs to identify opportunities, write convincing cases for support and conduct rigorous peer review and mentoring activities. We also provide internal investment through RKE Future Leaders and Research Accelerator Grants. Playing our part in the Industrial Strategy and future economy: We have won large awards for knowledge exchange projects that translate research in cyber security and AI into tangible benefits for the region’s economy and workforce. Our research and teaching nexus provides a fantastic opportunity for us to feed research-led innovations into a new way of doing things across Greater Manchester. Our large and expanding KTP portfolio is enabling us to translate new ideas into impact that benefits North West SMEs, and we will continue to grow this activity into the future. Using knowledge of funders more strategically: Regular bidding workshops across disciplines share specific funder knowledge. We have used this experience to work alongside our Research Development Manager to provide critical appraisal of proposals throughout. This has been a successful approach for us with BBSRC funding and with Royal Society funding in particular. Internal investment to support external income: As reported in section 2 we use internal funding to support early-stage ideas from our staff. Schemes such as the Strategic Opportunities Fund (SOF) and Research Accelerator Grants are used with precision to pump prime activities that have been worked up into full external proposals. For example, Dr Yap has been able to use internal investment to grow her research team and to develop collaborations with Image Metrics Ltd (output 2339) and CSols Ltd into successful awards from The Royal Society (£146,381) and Innovate UK (£218,486). This has resulted in more than 30 high-quality publications. The development of new clusters of expertise: We have invested in the development of significant new clusters of activity during the assessment period such as “Precision Agriculture”. With £30,000 internal support from the SOF and GCRF, Prof Han has constructed a portfolio of precision agriculture solutions for crop health management and monitoring, soil analysis and crop site management, which has generated more than £900,000 to Manchester Metropolitan and resulted in eight high-quality research papers.  Page 12  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Exceptional support from the RKE Directorate: We have a strong relationship with our Research Development Manager, who attends management meetings and works with us on long-term funding strategy. We also have access to an International Research Development Manager and an experienced Delivery team (see infrastructure below). Infrastructure Research and Knowledge Exchange Directorate (RKE) CfACS benefits from significant expertise in an expanded RKE Directorate. RKE includes research development and delivery, research ethics and governance, impact, business engagement, KTP support and The Graduate School (see REF 5a). We have access to fantastic RKE Systems including Symplectic for outputs and web profiles, Worktribe for external funding applications, EthOS for research ethics, and SkillsForge for managing the PGR student journey. We also have access to SciVal for benchmarking and reporting purposes. We have a press officer, an HR business partner, Information Systems support and expertise for the negotiation of RKE-related contracts and commercialisation activities. We receive excellent support for the management of our web and social media presence. Technical Support We receive support from 16 technicians organised across research-facing teams in Diagnostic, Mobile and Digital Computing (8 FTE) and Computational Facilities (8 FTE). Research Technicians manage our “core” facilities and provide hands-on expertise for research. We are a signatory to the Science Council and Gatsby Foundation’s Technical Commitment. IT Infrastructure We have access to a £500,000 Research Data Storage facility that provides a centrally managed data storage solution. This provides a system that is highly available with performance and storage capacity to meet current and future needs (multiple petabytes). Library Services Research Support Librarians provide access to 349 electronic databases including CORE, Scopus, Web of Science and Science Direct, and provide guidance on appropriate publishing routes, copyright, enquiries around Open Access and Research Data Management. The Library also manages green open access through the ‘e-space’ repository (integrated with Symplectic) and administers funding for article processing payments for gold open access. Specialist facilities Research takes place in the John Dalton Tower on 8 floors of combined research space. The Visual Computing Lab is equipped with six GPU machines (including one that is sponsored by Nvidia). Research on facial analysis uses high-speed cameras and a specialist machine for facial micro-expressions research. For human motion analysis, we have two types of depth sensors to measure movement. The CfACS IoT Lab has a 50-device test-bed of Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks. It is also equipped with specialist kit including IoT Care (Norma, Korea), Next Generation Firewall (Palo Alto Networks, US) and Quantum Secure IoT chipset (BST, UK). We have in-house tools, including Smart City Digital Twin, RFID deployment and planning tools, an indoor-IoT simulator and smart healthcare kits. Adaptive psychological profiling research within the Machine Intelligence theme utilises a stateof-the art Usability Lab to capture and analyse human behaviour utilising a wide range of technology including remote eye-tracking hardware (SMI RED 250) and the head-mounted eye tracking system (SMI) using lightweight glasses. Page 13  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Access to shared facilities and “in-kind” support A collaboration with Scan Computers enables us to use their DGX high-performance machine, and we secured Nvidia sponsorship for training in the use of deep learning algorithms. We also received an Oracle Innovation Accelerator Program Award to use their cloud infrastructure for the proof-of-concept phase of our FootSnap AI-enabled product (output 2354). 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society Support and effectiveness of collaborations, networks and partnerships Staff collaborate with a wide range of partners in many fields; the reach of this work is evidenced by the fact that 69% of our submitted 
outputs are co-authored with 114 international partners. We participate in various European consortia including iBorderCtrl with 13 partners including Leibniz University and the National Technical University of Athens, Populism and Civic Engagement (PaCE) with 8 partners including University of Helsinki and University of Salzburg, and ImageInLife with the University of Montpellier. Internationally, we work with partners in Pakistan on AI-enabled applications including National University of Science and Technology (NUST) and the National Centre for Artificial Intelligence. We have collaborations in China where we work on agritech applications and Internet of Things technology. We have visiting professorships at Sudan University of Science and Technology and Southwest University of China (Yap). In the UK, partnerships include the £12m GM AI and Cyber Foundry projects with Lancaster University, University of Manchester and Salford University. We are partners in the Cancer Research UK, EPSRC-funded ‘Mammobot’ project that is investigating breast cancer diagnosis with University of Bath, King’s College London, Leeds, Edinburgh and Imperial. We are working on the early detection of skin cancer using mobile devices with The Dermatology Centre at Salford Royal Foundation Trust. Contributions to the economy and society Our researchers make a major contribution to the regional economy through one of the UK’s largest KTP portfolios. We have been awarded 17 KTPs leading to new products and services for SMEs including Access Systems, Blueskytec, Cherry Pop Games, RAA IT, Kindus, REM UK, Service Power, Brodericks, Packaging Automation Limited and The Insights People. We even have an international KTP for a project that uses data to enhance crop yields with the University of Johannesburg. Outcomes of KTPs not featured in our impact case studies include research on quantum technology with Service Power Ltd that led to several patents and a £14m buyout from US investors in 2017. CfACS carries out research into the development of smart transport systems. We are partners with Network Rail on an Innovate UK funded project using disruptive radar technology to create 3D visualisations of subsurface rail infrastructure that will lead to improved safety for rail passengers. We have a KE Fellowship arrangement with the Transport Systems Catapult providing ongoing advice and consultancy and stimulating innovation projects. Research contributes to national policy. Prof Hammoudeh’s research on zero trust was cited nine times in the reports of the Joint Committee on National Security Strategy and the Joint Committee on Domestic Threat of Drones. Research in quantum annealing featured as a case study in a Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology publication. Prof Crockett’s work on place-based ethical AI has engaged policymakers and data scientists in round tables organised by think tank Policy Connect with the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Data Analytics. Prof Peng has been appointed as honorary visiting professor with SRFT and the Northern Care Alliance NHS Group to advise on the development of AI for health in the region. Prof Peng is collaborating with The Royal Veterinary College and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Page 14  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Medicine to investigate the applications of AI and machine learning in combating infectious disease and Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR). We undertake research in partnership with University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust (automation analysis of embryoscope images), Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (body scanning and selfesteem), Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (diabetes) and Norfolk and Norwich Teaching Hospital (breast cancer). We also collaborate with technology providers such as Oracle, Cisco, Croda and Image Metrics on health-related contributions to wider society. Public and end-user engagement We gain enormous benefits from public engagement both in terms of improving the quality and direction of our research but also the opportunity that it provides for staff and PGRs to collaborate on interesting projects. We believe in meaningful two-way public engagement in which the expertise of the public is valued. For example, the outcomes of our events at Manchester Science Festival are informing the future direction for the development of a Greater Manchester charter for ethical AI. Our staff frequently work with artists and authors to develop innovative forms of public engagement. ICS01 describes our collaboration with the awardwinning Manchester-based independent Comma Press who we have worked with over a number of years on popular science fiction anthologies inspired by our research. ICS01 also features Prof Crockett’s collaboration with world-renowned composer Bofan Ma, whose experimental pieces have featured in performances across Europe. Whilst we are enthused by the development of new forms of collaborative public engagement, we also engage the public through more traditional routes. Staff regularly contribute to schools engagement and outreach activities, and our researchers feature regularly in the broadcast and print media and use social media channels such as The Conversation.

"Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Institution: Leeds Beckett University Unit of Assessment: UoA11 – Computer Science and Informatics 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy 1.1 Context and structure The unit of assessment (UoA11) sits within the school of Built Environment, Engineering and Computing, one of the 10 schools within the university. All staff submitted to UoA11 reside in Computing (n=9) and electronic engineering (n=2). The unit conducts applied research addressing key societal challenges of the 21st century, namely energy, health and security. The school research direction embodies the principle of the British Computer Society ‘Making IT good for society’. The research within the unit of assessment seeks to create direct and lasting impact on energy sustainability, cybersecurity digital health, assistive and rehabilitation technologies, and medical devices working closely with external stakeholders in the private, public and third sectors. The unit comprises two research centres. The Cybercrime and security Innovation Centre (CSI) is a collaborative hub for research and development related to cybercrime, digital security, forensics and safety led by Dr Schreuders. The team specialise in cyber security, digital forensics, data science and analytics, and criminology. The CSI centre has a close working relationship with West Yorkshire Police; working directly with the Digital Forensics Unit (DFU) and Cyber Crime Team (CCT) to investigate and improve the way cybercrime and digital evidence is processed. The second research centre is the Centre for Research in Computer Science and Applications (CRISCA) led by Prof Tawfik. The focus of the research is machine learning, communication networks with applications in health and energy management. Information technology is pervasive in all aspects of society. The guiding principle for the unit’s research is to develop computer science research which encompasses applied computer science as an enabling tool for all disciplines and consequently all sectors, industrial, health, arts, media, and so on. As such much of the ongoing research within the school crosses the boundary of disciplines, researchers are investigating medical diagnostic devices for Parkinson’s Disease and dementia in collaboration with colleagues from biomedical sciences and the NHS led by Prof Monekosso and Dr Galbraith (UoA3), Dr Marino is evaluating the feasibility of miniaturizing a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Work is ongoing developing digital interventions (tools) for mental health with colleagues from psychology led by Prof Monekosso and Dr Holch (UoA4). Dr Palczewska is leading work on applying data analytics in sports and in healthcare. Dr Ibrahim is leading technology impact assessment on individuals and the public while Dr Nasir (UoA17) from the Business School is investigating the cost effectiveness of technologies Smart Cities in collaboration with sports and events organisers such Headingley Stadium (Leeds). The on-going pandemic has seen many of us working and learning remotely and a significant increase in internet usage. The widespread use and increased reliance on digital communication e.g. teleconsultation, telebanking, has created opportunities for criminal activity (cybercrime). The risk of cybercrime is greater than ever before and increasing. Cybersecurity research at Leeds Beckett is led by Dr Schreuders have collaborated since 2016 with West Yorkshire police force, investigating methods to solve some of their challenges as well as the training of officers. Digital health, in its broader sense, has evolved significantly in the last decade and it is widely accepted that it can increase efficiencies (administrative as well as clinical), improve quality of care and patients’ outcomes. This is reflected with the launch of NHSX in 2020 located in Leeds joining NHS Digital to support the development of digital health and healthcare technologies for the NHS. Research within the school sits well in the scope of their remit and includes health data analytics and clinical decision support, assistive and rehabilitation technologies as well as an emerging area of medical devices. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of and has accelerated the digital transformation in many sectors, not least in the health sector. Since 2018, colleagues in UoA11 have worked collaboratively with More Life, a university spin-off company operating in the health and wellbeing sector, to transform and augment its service with technology. The collaboration is led by Prof Monekosso who has developed an extensive programme coPage 1  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) funded by university and More Life to support the digital transformation of company operations and use More Life as a platform for research into data analytics to enhance operations, generate evidence of effectiveness of health interventions and investigates gamification methods and techniques to improve client retention. This work was accelerated by the pandemic with immediate impact on services and clients. Sustainable development is recognised by the United Nations as a key priority for the 21st century. Our research tackles two of the four pillars of sustainability, namely the environment and social pillars through research into different aspects of energy including cleaner energy and energy management. While Dr Colantuano is working with national and international partners to develop sustainable energy solutions for housing, the focus of Dr Kor’s work is Data Centres. The project partners include energy companies (EDF - Électricité de France S.A., a French multinational electric utility company, largely owned by the French state), local housing organisations (Carbery Housing Association in Ireland and First Choice Homes in the UK), and local authorities (Wakefield and District Housing Limited and Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council in the UK, Cork City Council in Ireland) and Facebook data centre in Lulea, Sweden. 1.2 Research and impact strategy The overall research strategy for Unit 11 is led by the Dean of the School, and Director of Research and feeding directly into the University Research and Enterprise Committee. Research integrity is upheld by all members of the unit, who assume personal and collective responsibility for their actions, overseen by the University Research Ethics Committee. These committees ensure research is conducted according to appropriate ethical, legal and professional frameworks, obligations and standards. The key objectives of the unit’s research strategy is to improve the environment and build the capacity for impactful research. It is guided by and builds on the university’s wider vision as a major anchor institution in the Leeds City region making a positive impact with specific reference to Health, Culture, and Sustainability. The School engages in health through research into digital health, assistive and rehabilitation technologies. Sustainability of energy sources is an important thread in the schools research approaching the challenge from different perspectives. The school’s research into cyber- and physical security engages with culture and sporting events. The key objectives were: 1. To build the capacity among existing and new staff to contribute excellent research, with the aims of broadening the research base of colleagues who have significant responsibility for research in line with our university Code of Practice. 2. To improve the quality of research undertaken in the unit, where the results of REF14 are the baseline. 3. To increase research income by refocusing our emphasis towards applied technologies – and thereby also to increase our beneficial impacts. The research strategy is guided by the principle of ‘technology as an enabling tool’ to address societal challenges and creating impact in the health, security and energy sectors. The approach is to work in close collaboration with regional, national and international organisations, in the public, private, and third sectors to understand their challenges. Understanding as well as contributing solutions to societal challenges requires the perspective of different disciplines and so the research is highly multi-disciplinary. 2. People The staff count in the Computing subject area is 38 of which 11 are classed as researchers with significant independence and a further 6 classed as early career researchers. These include staff registered for doctoral studies who are ‘working towards independence’ in our code of practice framework. Page 2  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) 2.1 Staffing strategy and staff development a) Appointment of established research leaders Following REF14, 3FTE research professors were appointed through external recruitment to provide leadership and develop targeted areas of strength in computer science. The aim was to drive research in the areas of machine learning, energy/control, and digital health. Professors: Deng (2015-); Monekosso (2015- ); Tawfik (2015- ). b) Appointment of a Director of Research The research leadership was strengthened with the appointment of a Director of Research (Monekosso) in 2016. This is a strategic leadership role for computer science & engineering, to define and implement research strategy for UoA11 staff. c) Investing in future research leaders Through internal promotions four readers (Dr Schreuders, Dr Kor, Gr Gorbenko, and Dr Akbari) were appointed to strengthen research in the areas of machine learning, sustainable computing, cybersecurity, and computer networks. 2.2 Post-doctoral staff Success in attracting research funding has seen in the current REF cycle a number of postdoctoral staff joining the unit. A total of nine post-doctoral staff are associated with externally funded projects compared to none in previous REF cycle. 2.3 Doctoral students a) Investing in researchers Since 2014, the school has invested in 6 doctoral students, 5 staff undertaking doctoral studies on a part-time basis. The total number in the REF cycle is 56 with a growing number of self-funded students. PhD completions are on an upward trend. Table 1 Doctoral completions  2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2 4  2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 4 5 3 5  b) Research students’ progress and development The research students are located in the school of Built Environment Engineering and Computing. The Graduate School, launched in February 2018, oversees all aspects of the University’s doctoral training and research staff development, integrating institution-wide PGR support with research career development. Tailored professional workshops are based on Vitae’s Research Development Framework through the research training programme for research students and a development programme for staff in all aspects of research activity. 2.4 Strategy beyond 2021 The strategy aims to significantly increase the proportion of staff classified as independent researchers, improve overall quality and impact of research. The objectives are to 1) Capitalise on and grow existing national networks, increase collaborative and interdisciplinary work, in particular work in sustainable energy and digital health 2) Build on existing international networks to extend the depth and breadth to increase impact reach 3) Improve research culture through mentoring, coaching and training for all staff commensurate with research stage 4) Develop an enhanced programme for post-doctoral staff to improve retention and provide greater continuity to research Page 3  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) 5) Support and train SLs and Readers preparing them for research leadership – the promotion scheme initiated in 2016 is now well established and is a foundation. Our research into digital health is based on co-creation with all stakeholders including patients and guided by the Code of conduct for data-driven health and care technology 1. The first principle relates to understanding users, their needs and the context. Our research also adheres to the equalities considerations as defined in the Evidence Standards Framework for Digital Health Technologies (NICE). Our research in assistive and rehabilitation technologies contributes to reducing health inequalities in the UK health and social care system, and improving access to care among hard-to-reach populations. 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities 3.1 Income generation Since 2014, the annual research income has steadily increased from £16,000 to £489,000 in the REF cycle. Income sources include a wider range of competitive funders such as UKRI (EPSRC), Royal Academy of Engineering, InnovateUK, European Union Horizon 2020, ERASMUS, and ERDF/Interreg programmes. Notable wins in the current REF cycle include two EPSRC grants (total £450K) investigating smart control of nuclear power plants, Police Knowledge Fund (£400K) Cybersecurity, EU H2020 large scale IA smart cities (€770K), EU ERDS Interreg (€1.4M) as coordinator and 3 ERASMUS including GENIAL – Green Networking and Cloud Computing (€480K). 2013-14 £16,000  2014-15 £67,000  Total Income 2015-16 2016-17 £69,000 £257,000  2017-18 £439,000  2018-19 £489,000  Commercial research activities have also increased through consultancies and knowledge transfer partnerships (KTP). A total of six knowledge transfer partnerships projects are either completed or ongoing. 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society The research within the unit of assessment seeks to create direct and lasting impact on energy sustainability, cybersecurity and digital health working closely with external stakeholders in the private, public and third sectors. Our research, particularly, the digital health strand is highly interdisciplinary with collaborators across disciplines including psychology, sociology, economics, arts and design as well as health. The challenges faced are global leading to several international collaborations. 4.1 Research collaborations The majority of our national and international collaborations fall into the UoA11 themes of health, security and energy and have emerged from projects funded by international bodies such EU collaborative research programmes e.g. EU research programmes such as H2020, Malaysian government High Impact Research programme, Spanish department of education, and US Department of Homeland Security as well as national funding bodies such EPSRC and Royal Academy of Engineering. Enhancing public security nationally and internationally The theme security can be split into physical and cybersecurity. A key collaboration with West Yorkshire police was established and cemented with the project CARI (2016-18) which saw LBU colleagues led by Dr Schreuders investigate and develop tools to support police in fighting 1 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-conduct-for-data-driven-health-and-caretechnology  Page 4  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) cybercrime. The Police Knowledge Fund CARI Project was a large-scale collaboration between the Cybercrime and Security Innovation Centre (CSI) at Leeds Beckett University (LBU) and West Yorkshire Police (WYP). The Project was designed to improve and incorporate an evidence-based approach into the policing of digital forensics and cybercrime investigations. The CARI Project also involved implementing a training and research programme. We provided training in research methods, to the entire Digital Forensics Unit, and the Cybercrime Team within WYP. Funded by EU H2020, a collaborative project saw UoA11 staff led by Prof Monekosso working with large event organisers in UK and across Europe to develop IoT technology to enhance the experience (security and wellbeing) of crowds at large outdoor events. The project involved Headingley stadium in Leeds, both the Yorkshire County Cricket Club and the Leeds Rhinos rugby league. The stadium has benefited from IoT technologies (intelligent cameras systems, staff localisation and tracking systems, crowd management tools/dashboard, and visitor information Apps) permanently installed to support crowd management and enhance their wellbeing. The same technologies where permanently installed at Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, in Lyon during the annual Fete de Lumiere events in December, and in Turin City centre as well as 
temporary infrastructure (once a year) at outdoor music festivals in Bonn (Germany) and suburbs of Turin, Italy. Supporting health and wellbeing There is a great deal of collaborative work in the field of health and social care technologies. Prof Tawfik is using an AI approach to inform the management of Obesity amongst young people in the UK, the design of which is informed by input from the Public Health Unit at Leeds City Council. In the same strand, collaborations with the University of Copenhagen (Denmark) on the application of Machine learning for obesity and diet management. Dr Palczewska’s collaborative work with the University of Leeds and Leeds City council on an EPSRC ‘Impact Acceleration Account’ project to design a risk stratification tool to help the City Council to identify clients in need of intensive social care provision in a timely manner, to support the wellbeing of individuals, and ultimately reduce the burden on the NHS. Work is ongoing with Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust (technologies to monitor and assess function in Parkinson’s disease), Hull Teaching Hospital NHS Trust (rehabilitation technologies) and St Georges’ Medical School NHS Trust London (Tools to support patient engagement) led by Prof Monekosso who is an honorary researcher at the Hull Teaching Hospital. These projects were supported in part by TRANSLATE and Grow MedTech programmes ( https://growmed.tech ), a collaboration between the Universities of Bradford, Huddersfield, Leeds Beckett, Sheffield Hallam and, led by the University of Leeds and funded through the Research England Connecting Capability Fund. Our research into digital health extends to technologies for social care. Working with Leeds City Council (assisted Living Services) to investigate adoption of technologies in care homes and to develop tools to support the data entry for electronic records. The work in this strand extends to international partner, for example rehabilitation technologies with the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia where Prof Monekosso is a visiting Professor and University Castilla la Mancha Spain. Another collaborative project in this strands  Page 5  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) were funded in part by Royal Academy of Engineering and the Malaysian High Impact Research programme investigated gait as a means determine to fall risk in cohort of older adults in Malaysia. Contributing to sustainable development through energy management There are 3 strands under his theme. The first strand applies AI to improve the safety of nuclear power plants funded by EPSRC led by Prof Deng in collaboration with Liverpool and Portsmouth universities. The aim of this research is improving nuclear power plants' availability, reducing the cost of operation, helping the decision-making in the nuclear control room, and assisting the preparedness of different accident levels. This research demonstrated its potential and applicability based on a case study scenario from India (2016-18). The second strand in energy is the Sustainable IT work investigating energy measurement and management as well as energy efficiency. On a macroscopic scale, the research focuses on data centres led by Dr Kor. Sustainability of data centres is the focus of investigation in the project ‘project GENIAL – Green Networking and Cloud Computing led by Dr Kor. At a microscopic level, energy management at the ‘chip’ level, Dr Marino is investigating a reconfigurable processor approach using the “RISC-V processor” - known as the “new Linux in hardware” aiming to repurpose its instruction set to reduce power in embedded systems. From sustainable IT to sustainable housing, our school is conducting research into energy management in homes in collaboration with local councils and housing associations. Dr Colantuono is co-ordinating a large EU-funded project (RED WoLF) using technology to increase renewables' usage and reduce CO2 emission for Homes with Photovoltaics without gas connection. The RED WoLF project comprises six test-bed sites in the UK, France and Ireland. Further collaborations Outside the three strands collaboration exist with the University of Seville (Spain) on the optimisation of mobility models for drones in disaster recovery scenarios (Prof Tawfik); collaboration with the University of Lorraine and Lulea University of Technology on green networking, pervasive computing and communications; and the Kharkiv Aviation Institute: National Aerospace University (Dr Kor and Dr Gorbenko) on IoT applications; and University of Newcastle (Dr Gorbenko) on software system reliability, and dependability. 4.2 Supporting local SME growth by accelerating digital transformation and innovative product development We use our expertise in data analytics and systems engineering to contribute to the growth of SMEs in the region. UoA11 colleagues have been successful in building links with companies in the Leeds City Region and further afield. Several long standing and successful collaborations with the private sector have evolved and cemented with InnovateUK KTP projects. The companies include Essentials Healthcare (KTP10303, 2016-18), Omega Security Systems (KTP10304, 201618) and Abbey Industrial Systems (KTP10623, 2016-19) fall firmly into the core areas of health and social care technologies and Bob's Business Ltd (KTP10674, 2017-19) falls into security. Further KTP collaborative projects focusing on data analytics include Citu (One) Limited (KTP10266, 2015-18) and The Label Makers Ltd (KTP10942, 2017-20). Since 2019, a significant collaborative programme in health and well-being is emerging between computer science (UoA11) and More Life Ltd, a university spin-off (turnover £6M). More Life Page 6  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) provides health and well-being services under contract from local authorities nationally and the NHS. The aim of the collaborative programme is to support the digital transformation of More Life services with data analytics research and the development of its IT infrastructure with the aim of improving productivity. Prof Monekosso has been instrumental in creating a roadmap for digital services and advising on the development of the IT infrastructure. An early success of this collaboration is an NHSE contract (2020/S 192-465180) to provide a national digital weight management service. Prof Monekosso is now engaged as Chief Technical Officer (CTO) for More Life developing a research and innovation strategy in collaboration with the university (UoA11) for a data-driven approach for More Life’s health and wellbeing services, operations and the IT infrastructure to support the NHSE contract. UoA11 staff contribute data analytics expertise for evidence generation on the effectiveness of interventions, on productivity of operations and gamification. 4.3 National and International Expert Advisor Roles In the last REF cycle, UoA11 staff have increasingly engaged in advisory roles regionally, nationally and internationally. Notable roles include commissioner (Prof Monekosso) at Digital Futures Commission, 5Rights Foundation an organisation founded and chaired by Baroness Beeban Kidron OBE which aims to enable Children and Young People to Access the digital world creatively, knowledgeably and fearlessly. At City level, Prof Monekosso sits on the advisory board of Phase 2 Assisted Living, Digital Health project, Leeds City Council and on the EPSRC Inclusion Matters Project led by Durham University which aims to improve the experiences of under-represented groups in STEM research. Prof Tawfik serves on the ‘Knowledge Societies’ working group for the Eurocities Network to disseminate the potential societal impact of research more widely. Colleagues within the school act as evaluators for MRC, EPSRC, EU research programme, Cyprus’s Research Promotion Foundation, Polish National Science Centre, and The Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (Prof Tawfik, Prof Monekosso). Prof Monekosso is a member of UKRI Future Leaders Fellowships Programme Peer Review College 4.4 Contribution to academic disciplines and learned societies Several members of the school serve on editorial boards for international journals. These include: Learned societies The natural home for UoA11 staff is British Computer Society. Dr Ramachandran is fellow of British Computer Society and Prof Monekosso is honorary fellow of British Computer Society. Both Profs Tawfik and Monekosso are senior IEEE members and Dr Marino is member of the IEEE STC Parallel Model and Systems Data Flow and Beyond since 2017 Editorial boards Colleagues are actively engaged in editorial boards for international peer-reviewed journals covering diverse areas of computer science. These include: • Future Generation Computer Systems (Dr Kor), • International Journal of Embedded Systems (Dr Marino) • International Journal of High Performance Computing and Networking (Dr Marino) • IEEE Access (Dr Marino) • Neurocomputing (Prof Monekosso); • International Journal of Neural Computing and Applications (Prof Tawfik). Page 7  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) •  International Journal of Organizational and Collective Intelligence (Dr Ramachandran).  Further examples of international collaboration in research is manifested in the guest-editorship of special issues in reputable journals with international researchers. Examples of this are the special issue for the Applied Soft computing (Elsevier 2020) and Medical Informatics (Elsevier, 2016) (Prof Tawfik), IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Human Machine Systems (Prof Monekosso, 2015); a special issue for the Journals of Future Generation Computer Systems (2016), Network and Computer Applications (Elsevier, 2017), and International Journal of Grid Computing (Springer, 2019) (Dr Ramachandran). Conference organisation and hosting During this REF period, we have organised, hosted and co-chaired two international, IEEEsponsored, computer science and engineering conferences: the 10th International Conference on Dependable Systems, Services and Technologies (DESSERT 2019), and the international Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering (DeSE’2016).

"Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Institution: University of Huddersfield Unit of Assessment: UoA11 Computer Science and Informatics 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy Context and Structure The Unit’s research at The University of Huddersfield is centred in the Department of Computer Science within the School of Computing and Engineering, with all staff entered being members of that department. The Unit has grown significantly in research mass within the census period, with 27.2 FTE staff being entered compared to 14.4 FTE in 2014. The Unit benefits from strong ties to the School’s other department, Engineering and Technology, with which it shares some research groups and funded projects. Computer Science research submitted to the Unit is organised in several groupings: 1. PARK: (Planning, Autonomy and Representation of Knowledge), the largest and longest running group, with specialisms in Automated Planning and Semantic Web, led by Antoniou and McCluskey. It developed our Impact Case Study “New AI technologies for enriching and recovering value from urban data with applications to traffic management"", and recently opened two application-focussed Centres with external partners, the Centre for Intelligent Transport Management (CITM), and the Centre of Artificial Intelligence for Mental Health (CAIMH). 2. CVIC: (Centre for Visual and Immersive Computing), with specialisms in real-time CCTV analysis, augmented reality and machine vision for smart factory automation, led by Xu, who developed our Impact Case Study ""Enabling commercial impact from innovations in visual computing"". 3. CCS: (Centre for Cyber Security), a recently established Centre with specialisms in applying AI techniques to intrusion detection and access control, led by Parkinson; 4. CIndA: (Centre for Industrial Analytics), a recently established Centre with specialisms in IoT and Cloud Architectures, and strong links to CERN, led by Hill and Lane. 5. CMDS (Centre for Mathematics and Data Science), a joint venture with Engineering and Technology to support mathematical research and teaching within the School, whose members include Murtagh and Titarenko. 6. TAML (Technology Acceptance and Mobile Learning) research group, whose leaders Ward and Lu created our Impact Case Study ""Enabling better mobile learning for digital skills development"". Development of the Unit’s Research and Impact Strategy The Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy first issued a policy document in 2013 outlining their envisioned global grand challenges. In September 2019 this document was updated with primary grand challenges. The University’s long term strategy has been based on supporting “areas of strategic research importance” (ASRIs), consistent with these global grand challenges, to foster an interdisciplinary societal underpinning of research throughout the University. The ASRIs relevant to the Unit must be viewed in a multi-disciplinary context, and include Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security, Internet of Things and Cloud Computing, Intelligent Page 1  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Manufacturing and Maintenance, Autonomous Systems, Data Science, Big Data Analytics and Visualisation. The University has published a 5-year strategy map with clear aims in each area of the University’s activities (cf Institutional Level Statement ILS). The University’s long-term vision has research growth at its core, influencing our objectives below. The ILS contextualises this research focus: no academic members of staff are on teaching only contracts, and 100% of all academic staff are to be publishing at international excellence levels. For the Unit’s staff this translates to the following strategy with clear objectives: 1) Structure research around Research Centres with an ASRI focus: the structure of the Unit into a group of subject-related Centres provides the intellectual support for academics to grow within an environment which fosters collaborative research. The Unit initially had two centres covering ASRIs (PARK and CVIV) at the start of this census period and since then we have sought to expand these to include other ASRIs. This leads to our first 2 objectives: ? ?  obj-a) consolidation and further investment in established research centres. obj-b) cultivation of new interdisciplinary areas of both research and impact, in line with University ASRIs.  2) Steer research activity to being pervasive and outward-facing among academic staff: actions such as internal funding and new staff recruitment are focussed around the research centre ethos, with all staff being attached to existing centres, or research groups with the potential to achieve centre status. Collaboration with national and international partners will be encouraged to augment internal support and mentorship. This leads to our third objective, which is a direct mapping of the University KPI on academic staff: ?  obj-c) increase the number of academic staff active at international level in computer science research to include all academic staff.  3) Focus the activities of Centres on achieving both academic, economic and societal impact: centres primarily must be based on the research of international excellence, from which we will then seek to achieve societal economic impact, utilising an interdisciplinary focus. This leads to our 4th and 5th objectives: ? ?  obj-d) increase significantly the societal and economic impact of our research activities both through established and through new research centres. obj-e) increase significantly the academic impact of our research activities both through international collaboration and quality and quantity of outputs.  Quantitatively, we equate the success of our strategy and the achievement of our objectives to the doubling of metrics (funding, PhDs, internationally excellent publications, etc) between 2014 and 2021, and commit to a similar increase for the next period. Current Research Growth and Vitality To measure whether we are succeeding, firstly we can compare our performance using the aspirations within the REF5 template for REF2014, and secondly, we show how during this census period we are meeting our strategy objectives.  Page 2  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Our UoA 11 REF5 submitted to REF2014 stated that we would double our research outcomes by the end of the subsequent REF period. We have achieved these aims in good measure as follows: ? the number of PhDs awarded per year has more than doubled ? the amount of external research income per year has more than doubled ? the FTE of staff being submitted to REF2021 has almost doubled - 14.4 to 27.2 ? the number of research students enrolled in July 2020 was at least 50% higher than the beginning of the current census period. As an illustration of how we are meeting objectives obj-a) and obj-e), during the census period, at least 44 outputs at CORE A / A* rated Artificial Intelligence conferences were published by University staff from the PARK research centre alone. The table below details the year (first row), the conference venues (second row) and the total publication numbers each year (third row), with multiple papers at the same venue also shown. This gives clear evidence of the vitality within PARK’s research environment which is leading to research of the highest quality.  2014 3*ICAPS  2015 AAAI, 3*IJCAI, IROS  2016 2*AAAI, ICLP, IEEECDC, KR, IJCNN  2017 AAAI, 2*ICAPS, IJCAI, 2*K-CAP, ESWC  2018 2*AAAI, 2*ICCS, 2*IEEEFUZZ, ICLP  3  5  6  7  7  2019 AAAI, ICAPS, AAMAS, 2*ICCS, 4*IEEEFUZZ, KCAP 10  2020 AAAI, 2*ICAPS, ICLP, ICCS, IEEEFUZZ 6  To illustrate our progress on obj-b), we started the assessment period with existing strengths in Artificial Intelligence and Visual Computing (PARK, CVIC). Initial applications of automated planning to security led Parkinson to create the CCS which now includes areas of block chain, cryptography, and network security, and has supported the creation of new degrees in BSc Cyber Security with Computer Science and MSc Cyber Security and Digital Forensics. New professorial appointments Hill and Lane initiated research in cloud architectures and IoT and their application to complex industrial data, and forged the creation of the CIndA. New initiatives also include interdisciplinary research, for example two new Computer Science Department Professorial appointments Murtagh and Lee (Lee is submitted to UoA 12) have led to the establishment of the CMDS, a joint venture with Engineering. The School’s composition of Computing and Engineering has also led to interdisciplinarity, for example 4 staff in PARK are being submitted to UoA 12. An exemplar illustrating the effect of our strategy’s focus on interdisciplinary research is the new £1.8M Smart Rolling Stock Maintenance project funded via the European Regional Development Fund and supported by the Northern Powerhouse. The project is led by the University’s Institute of Railway Research (IRR) (UoA 12) in collaboration with PARK, and involves a range of key industry partners including Northern Trains Ltd, Porterbrook and Unipart Rail over the course of its three-year run (2020-2023). PARK leaders Antoniou and McCluskey are Co-Is with responsibility for delivering automated planning and scheduling solutions for rolling stock maintenance management, autonomy for the robotic devices involved in maintenance, and for ontology development underlying system and process models within maintenance depots.  Page 3  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) With regard to obj-c), we can point to the body of staff being submitted to REF to indicate degree of pervasiveness of research culture through the department: of academic staff in the Department not REF-submitted, either their research falls into a different Unit, they are yet to secure a PhD, and/or they are at a teaching assistant or research assistant status. We are delivering on obj-d) as evidenced by our three Impact Case Studies (named above, in Transport Management, Mobile Learning and Computer Vision and Visualisation), as well as delivering significant impact to Health (Antoniou) and Security (Parkinson), detailed in the sections below. Support for Research Growth Researchers apply for funding via a wide variety of mechanisms as shown by our REF period funding profile in Section 3. To help researchers engage in these activities University investments in the School include a Research and Business Development team (the RBD team) which include two Business Development staff, a Research Development Manager, and an Impact Officer. Coupled with the growth of pre- and post-award teams to support academics/researchers in securing and delivering new research projects, these investments in supporting infrastructure have helped to deliver research income and consequent research impact (described in more detail in Section 3 of this document). The Unit (primarily though the RBD team) also draws heavily on the University central resources to support technology transfer activities, as well as the growing legal and contracts teams that help facilitate contractual/collaboration arrangements with industry partners to achieve impact. Three particular factors guarantee the sustainability of our progress in growth of research and impact: Institutional Support: Over the census period, the University has invested ~£7.9M institutionally in supporting delivery of its Research Strategy (via the “University Research Fund” or URF), and examples of the effectiveness of these funds are given in this document. This will continue into the next research period (cf ILS). New Application-Focussed Initiatives: 2020 saw the creation of several new, exciting initiatives in terms of interdisciplinary positioning of the Unit’s research outputs: ?  ?  ?  the creation of CITM (cf Context and Structure), a collaboration between members of PARK and staff from Kirklees Local Council, SimplifAI Systems Ltd, to deploy AI technology to autonomously perform urban transport management; the creation of CAIMH (cf Context and Structure), a collaboration between members of PARK and the University’s School of Human and Health Sciences and South-West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, in the application of AI techniques to ADHD, autism and suicide prevention; the coordination of a Framework Research Collaboration Agreement by members of CindA with CERN’s Beam Instrumentation Group to deploy novel opto-electronic sensing and associated signal detection and processing.  New Significant Research Awards: As well as the interdisciplinary £1.8M Smart Rolling Stock Maintenance award mentioned above, in 2020 Vallati received a prestigious UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship award (FLF) entitled “Artificial Intelligence for Autonomic Urban Traffic Page 4  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Control“. The FLF, in partnership with Transport for Greater Manchester, Kirklees Council, and SimplifAI Systems Ltd, will last four years, will last four years initially with the opportunity to extend to seven years, with a grant of £1.4M. Research Governance Research activity in the School is overseen by the School Research and Enterprise Committee (SREC). Membership of SREC includes all professors and others in the School with a strategic role. Day to day research management including allocation of University funding and oversight of REF activity is coordinated by the School-wide REF Operations Group. In the Unit, Centre Leaders are members of the SREC and the REF Operations Group, and with the Unit Coordinator and Head of Department are responsible for developing Unit-level strategies such as those in this document. Open Research The Unit is committed to ensuring publicly funded research is openly accessible, transparent, collaborative and efficient. We use systems the University has invested in to promote open research and open access to research outputs, and research data management (e.g. Elsevier’s PURE information system). Where conflicts may occur (e.g. industry funded research, new IP requiring protection prior to publication) support is provided to researchers from the RBD team to proactively manage issues within the context of the Institution’s policies. An example of open access is the Phishing Database set up by McCluskey’s research student Rami Mohammad in the UCI Machine Learning repository, with 100-200 downloads every month in the last year as evidenced in http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/24330/. An example of open research is Antoniou’s EU-funded project Semdata www.semdataproject.eu/ won under the FP7 Marie Curie International Researcher Exchange Scheme, in the area of semantic data management. Research Integrity The Unit is committed to having a culture that promotes research integrity, in line with the University’s commitment to the Concordat to Support Research Integrity. An institutional Code of Practice for Research provides the framework under which researchers operate, and all new projects and proposals are subject to ethical review and approval as part of a standard sign-off process prior to project approval. Where specific ethical concerns may exist, the School Research Ethics Committee provides guidance and support to researchers, as well as a link to the Institution’s University Research Committee which has overall governance of research integrity. As an example of this approach, Antoniou recently obtained IRAS approval for a project he is leading with South-West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust on suicide risk assessment. 2. People Staffing Strategy Staffing strategy within the Unit has underpinned our research strategy, with an ambition to grow high quality research with impact. Therefore, a successful research track-record is a prerequisite for all new academic and researcher staff appointments, with all expected to have a PhD, and to have a research record that fits into our Centre-based culture (at the time of the Page 5  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) census, 90% of computer science academic staff had PhDs). In the case of senior appointments there is an expectation that track-record will include significant high-quality research outputs, evidence of securing competitively awarded research funding, and of successful collaboration with external partners. In the case 
of early career appointments, evidence of the potential to develop these outputs is a key element of the recruitment process. In order to achieve the increase in research over this REF period we have applied this strategy, increasing the number of full time Professors from 3 at the end of REF2014, to currently 9 Professors, and making in total 13 new appointments out of the 29 (head count) submitted staff. These new appointments have built up strength in existing Centres, and enabled creation of new Centres such as the CindA and CMDS. Over the REF period our REF2014 QR funds and Central internal research funding support (URF) have been used predominantly to pay for research fellows to assist research centres deliver on their research growth. Three of these research fellows initially supported by internal funding are now members of the Full Time Lecturing staff (Chen-T, Tachzimidis and Bargiannis). The University introduced a Research Excellence Scheme (RESS) in 2016 which aims to provide opportunities to excellent research staff from other Institutions to join the University on indefinite contracts. During the REF period this has amounted to two professorial appointments in this Unit, linked to specific ASRIs: Murtagh (Data Science) and Lane (IoT and Cloud Computing). Murtagh subsequently formed the cross-school Mathematics Group which has added substantially to teaching and research and supports the CMDS. Staff development strategy for all staff pursuing a career in research In terms of staff development and advancement, the Unit adheres to the national Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers, which sets out the seven key principles for funders and employers of researchers in the UK. The Unit aims to support staff according to these principles whatever their career stage and believes a supportive culture enhances researcher performance, improves staff retention, and aids recruitment of both staff and postgraduate students. All staff undergo an annual personal development review/appraisal which includes consideration of research performance and planning, including identification of specific training and development needs/opportunities. Research performance is an important metric for successful career progression of all academics, with indicators such as research outputs, income and successful Post Graduate Researcher (PGR) supervision essential for progression to senior academic/researcher positions. During the current REF period 4 staff were promoted internally to Professor (Faber, Ward, Crampton, and Xu) and 3 to Reader (Parkinson, Vallati, and Venters). In terms of development and training, the Unit has access to a large institutional staff development portfolio which is mapped against the Vitae Researcher Development Framework. The Unit has actively engaged with the University’s initiative – for example, in an initiative with the Chartered Management Institute for senior and mid-level staff to achieve Level 7 management qualifications and obtain Chartered Manager status. In the REF period 5 senior academics – Hill, Antoniou, Carter, Ward, and Crampton in the Unit have so far achieved this goal. The School’s RBD team has also established a Researchers’ Network (aimed primarily towards early career staff but open to all) and are running regular seminars and workshops on topics of interest and value to the community (e.g. the funding landscape, IP protection and exploitation, how to build industry partnerships, maximising impact from research, etc.). These are designed Page 6  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) to supplement centrally provided training and are practical/operationally focussed, encouraging researchers to share their own experiences and challenges with colleagues. The team are at the heart of support for staff: their effectiveness was recognised by the University as they won the Outstanding Contribution to Research and Innovation Support award in 2015. Support for Career Development of Researchers All new academic staff appointees are provided with an introduction to the various support structures with regards to research such as Pre-Award, Post-Award, PURE and the RBD team. Each member of staff is assigned a mentor, and a research group (normally part of a Research Centre). Staff benefit from mentoring within the context of their respective research groups, all of which hold regular (typically weekly) seminar series where researchers can present and discuss their work with peers and their senior group members and by providing help as appropriate to identify key collaborators, establishing likely funding sources and assisting in drafting bids. Staff early in their career are actively encouraged and supported in gaining experience of supporting undergraduate and/or postgraduate teaching activities. Both Parkinson and Vallati, in particular, achieved success supported by the Department’s development infrastructure: both won Researcher in Residence awards from The Catapult Network. Within the University, Vallati was nominated for Outstanding Early Career Researcher (2015), and Parkinson won University research supervisor of the year 2020. There is much evidence for the success of our early career support: all three ECRs from the Department submitted in REF2014 (Vallati, Batsakis and Chrpa) now have teaching responsibilities, and two of them have senior positions - Vallati is Reader in the Department, and Chrpa is now Assistant Professor at Prague Technical University. Parkinson was an undergraduate and doctoral student at The University: subsequently he became a lecturer and has attained Readership status, and now is leader of the CCS. The University runs interdisciplinary sandpits which are aimed particularly to encourage early career staff, and have supported Bargiannis, Valatti and Tachmazidis. The School has a Research Development Manager (Dr David MacDougal) to guide staff in their early career on the path to grant application success. The School supports Sabbatical Leave and Leave of Absence where it would enable an academic to carry out a specific programme of research and development, or the completion of a commissioned book or research paper or the preparation of a major research grant application. For example, Ward developed the iDEA method during a 12-month sabbatical leave within Buckingham Palace, leading to TAML’s Impact Case Study. The Unit takes advantage of the University’s Collaborative Ventures Fund (CVF) which provides up to £2,500 of internal funding for academics to work on short feasibility projects for external companies at no cost to them. This has led to key relationships being developed resulting in KTP projects, sponsored PhDs, Innovate-UK funded projects, with more details in Section 4. Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity The Unit is committed to creating and maintaining a culture of research diversity and recognises that a positive and supportive environment where researchers from all backgrounds can flourish will significantly support the Unit’s future ambitions.  Page 7  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Similarly, the University is committed to EDI and has robust policies and codes of practice to guide and support staff and PGRs. In 2020, the University signed up to the Race Equality Charter (REC) and completed the Investing in Ethnicity Maturity Matrix to inform the REC action plan. In 2018, the University was accredited as a Disability Confident Employer and was a signatory to the Mindful Employer Charter; it is also a Stonewall Champion and participated in the Stonewall Equality Index in 2019. The University has four staff networks (LGBTQI+, BAME, Women and Disability) run by members with support from the University EDI Officer. The University has Athena Swan Bronze accreditation and the School in which the Unit sits is also working towards an Athena Swan Bronze award. EDI is also a priority within the University’s REF2021 Code of Practice, and a detailed Equality and Impact Assessment (EIA) has been completed as part of the process of selecting staff outputs for inclusion within the REF assessment process. EDI influences our behaviour in the Unit, for example it is mandatory for senior staff to undertake the University’s on-line ‘unconscious bias’ and ‘diversity in the workplace’ modules. An equality impact assessment was undertaken for the Unit and was used in the final identification of output pool prior to submission. The most significant factor in UoA11 affecting SRR/IR selection was postgraduate qualification, for example more than one third of staff who were identified as not-SRR are still studying for a doctorate degree. Regarding PGR students, personal learning support plans (PLSP) are developed for all who require one. This is written following an interview between the PGR and the central University Disability Team. Support is provided for those who declare a disability and is determined by the content of the PLSP, whether this be specific display screen equipment or support from the School Guidance Team. PGR Student Recruitment, Development and Progression Student Recruitment  At the end of the census period the Unit had 64 doctoral research students enrolled (43 FT and 21 PT, a rise of 50% from the start of the census period), with nearly two thirds of them being international. Recruitment of PGRs follows a robust recruitment process with all projects/potential projects being advertised through a variety of channels, including the University’s main application platform ‘Coursefinder’. The Unit follows the University wide recruitment process for all of its doctoral research students, which includes a review of the proposals by the research group/supervisor, interviews, completion of a Pre-Enrolment Form and ensuring all the relevant checks are completed before the applicant is offered a place at the University. Internal funding has been provided to accelerate growth in research and enterprise and one scheme which is available to potential research students is the fee waiver, where University fees are fully or partly waived on the basis of merit. Since the beginning of the census period, 46 fee waivers have been awarded to PhD and Masters by Research students. Examples of external funding include Murtagh’s 4-year EPSRC NPIF award “Mathematical Foundations of Optical Nano and Micro Mass Spectroscopy” which commenced October 2018. The Unit also benefits from opportunities to collaborate within our sister engineering department’s EPSRC Doctoral Training Programme, which fully funds a number (currently 12) of PhD studentships each year. Page 8  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Details of monitoring and progression-support mechanisms: All doctoral research students are required to submit a Research Plan and Skills Audit after three months (pro rata for part time and after two months for Masters). The purpose of this is to enable students to develop a clear plan for their research project, to explore the skills and training which will be required, gain any required ethics approval, to perform an initial literature search and from this to identify their research question. Records of supervisions are kept by both students and supervisors in the University’s SkillsForge platform. Progression vivas are held after 9 and 21 months, for which students are required to submit an annual report detailing their progress, and then give a short presentation to a panel consisting of two academics from the subject area who are not involved in the student’s supervision (this allows also for frank discussion of the student’s level of satisfaction with the supervision provided). For progression to be approved, the examiners must be satisfied that the student has made sufficient progress both intellectually and in terms of timescale for completion. Research training needs form part of the discussion in these vivas. Continued support in the preparation for these milestones is provided primarily by the supervision team; generally comprising of a main supervisor, second supervisor and personal tutor. Additional provision is available within the Unit by our Academic Skills Tutor and from a central provision within the Academic English Centre, which provides a variety of targeted workshops and courses. Organised courses on areas such as academic writing, plagiarism and reviewing literature are complemented by tailored one to one support if required. For example, the five half-day sessions of the Essential Journal Writing Skills Course are mandatory for all full-time doctoral research students and introduces the art of producing original research articles with a focus on crafting introductions and reviewing literature with detailed guidance on paraphrasing, referencing and avoiding plagiarism. All doctoral research students receive an electronic newsletter which provides an overview of the upcoming courses and workshops. To ensure that the voice of the doctoral research student is heard and considered, the Unit runs a PGR Student Forum twice per annum with membership comprising of the Director of Graduate Education (DoGE), four student representatives (across all Units within the School of Computing and Engineering), one Student’s Union representative, two academics, one library representative, one technician and one secretary. The Forum has a Terms of Reference and is formally recorded. All School and University Committees have representation from a doctoral research student, again to ensure the voice of the PGR is heard and considered. In addition to the high-level academic support and development as described above, examples of additional resources available include training on research ethics and integrity in our on-line Researcher Environment, our Teaching Assistant Preparation Programme and the University's Careers and Employability Service. Research students are encouraged to engage with internal events such as our Three Minute Thesis competition and the annual PGR Conference as well as presenting at external conferences and academic meetings. The Unit provides financial support to each doctoral research student in the form of a £300 contribution towards a national conference and £500 towards an international conference, through our Conference Presentation Fund. For an example of its effectiveness, during the UK PlanSIG Workshop in 2020, out of the 11 papers presented, 3 had current PhD students in PARK as first authors (R.Reba, S.Mund and H.Jaazaa). 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities Page 9  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Strategy for generating income Utilise the Research Centre structure: the Research Strategy detailed in the first section of this document hinges on growth in research and impact. The structure of the Unit into a set of ASRIrelated Centres provides the intellectual support for academics to grow within an environment which fosters mentorship and collaborative research. The success of the PARK group is evidence of this, and the other, new Centres are likewise providing the same kind of environment. As an example, the CCS became a standalone research centre in 2017 (formally the academics were part of PARK research centre). This has resulted in more focus on cyber security research and a total of £260k of income has been generated by Parkinson via a variety of different grants and sources including UKRI, government, Innovate UK, KTP and industry investment. Reinvest Research Income into Centres: in order to help grow research and research income within each centre, the School has a strategy of reinvesting any research surpluses back into that research centre. This has supported obj-a) in our strategy, with research centres (particularly PARK) being enabled to grow their resources by employing new research fellows and offering PhD bursaries. Provide close mentorship and bid development advice: as covered in Section 2 above, the School and University have a range of support mechanisms for supporting grant bidding, particularly those relatively inexperienced. With 13 new academic appointments in the census period, developing the bid-winning potential of each member of staff is of paramount importance. For example, Vallati’s successful bid for a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship started years before with mentorship and subject assistance within PARK, as 
well as the benefit of international collaborations. The identification of this particular mechanism was recommended and assisted by our Research Development Manager (see Section 1) with industrial connections cemented by our RBD team. While every external bid in the School has to be peer reviewed and signed off before submission, the development of Vallati’s bid in particular was monitored, reviewed and supported by his mentor, the Research Development Manager, and other School-wide senior staff, to maximise his chance of success. Develop and grow commercialisation opportunities: the School and Unit has been increasing support for achievement of societal impact (strategic objective obj-d)), and the development of more user-led research. This is consistent with University Strategy map KPI of 15% of research outputs by 2025 to be generated in collaboration with end users. Progress has been facilitated by the increased support within the RBD team (with two new appointments since 2014) as well as the development of a Research Finance Support Team. This extra support has been particularly important in the commercialisation of our Urban Transport Management research (more details in PARK’s ICS). Also, Lane has secured £50k from the ERA foundation and £30k from the Royal Academy of Engineering to develop both education activities and technical engagement with manufacturing SMEs to support them with the adoption of Industrial Digital Technologies. Submitted Unit’s Income  UoA 11 has had a steady portfolio of research income year on year underpinned by a combined investment in new academics, new research centres, research support infrastructure, mentoring and development of academic staff. The research funding for the census period has increased Page 10  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) compared to the last REF period by a per-year factor of more than two (total income for the REF2014 period was £589K and total income for the current census period is £1,983K). We continue to maintain a strategy of developing a mixed portfolio of grant funding resulting in a balance between Industry, UKRI, EU and Government funding. While EU income has declined, commercial income has increased, and with recent funding successes, Research Council grant income should also rise to compensate for this (see Table below). There has been a significant increase in bids during this REF period from a greater number of academics. Our bidding portfolio has also increased from £2.5M worth of bids in academic year 15/16 to £3.7M of bids in academic year 19/20. This aligns with the increased support both centrally and with the School to facilitate the bidding process, provide training and support and the increased academic mentoring with research centres. Percentage Income per Annum and Income Sources 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20 Total BEIS 25.9% 41.9% 63.7% 7.0% 6.9% 14.2% 12.5% 22.2% Research Councils, The Royal Society etc UK-based 3.3% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 3.3% 19.7% charities (open competitive process) UK central 10.8% 2.7% 6.7% 25.2% 61.4% 55.1% 19.7% 29.8% government bodies/local authorities UK industry, 0.0% 0.0% 11.5% 29.2% 14.7% 14.3% 40.2% 15.6% commerce and public corporations UK other 1.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 9.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% sources EU government bodies  63.4%  55.4%  18.1%  29.5%  17.0%  13.2%  6.1% 27.9%  EU-based charities (open competitive process)  0.0%  0.0%  0.0%  0.0%  0.0%  0.0%  1.8%  0.3%  Exemplars of Success in Grant Income and Commercialisation As part of growing commercialisation opportunities in the Unit, five Knowledge Transfer Partnerships have been awarded within the census period (growing from zero) and totalling £800K of current and potential future research grant income. In order to continue growing the Page 11  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) number of KTPs, a strategy of maintaining a portfolio of three KTPs running at any one time was agreed. By the end of this REF period the Unit has successfully achieved this outcome (current KTPs with ValueChain, Brandon Medical and Andel Ltd). Alongside the KTP target, there has been a focus on working with our company partners to apply for Innovate UK grants and to look at commercialisation opportunities. An exemplar is McCluskey and Vallati’s collaboration with Transport Consultants which led to grants of progressive size: starting with an internal CVF of £5000, this led to a consortium project including British Telecom and Transport for Greater Manchester winning funding from the Innovate UK Competition “Solving Urban Challenges with Data” (2015 - 2016). This resulted in a Transport-Consultants-led Innovate UK First of a Kind collaboration of approximately £1M, of which PARK secured £150,000. This further led to the establishment of a joint venture company (SimplifAI Systems Ltd), between PARK and the Transport Consultants, of which the University owns 15% of shares, and the establishment of the collaboratively-run CITM detailed in Section 1 above. Infrastructure and facilities The School has invested in a dedicated state-of-the-art space for PGR students including hotdesking facilities for over 50 students, lockers, meeting rooms, chill out area, kitchen facilities, and a dedicated admin team. A new Technical Services Manager has also been appointed bringing all the technical and IT technicians under one management structure resulting in more joined-up support for our researchers. Staff and research students have access to a wide range of computer facilities, humanoid and other robots, servers and specialist computer software. For example, the deterministic track of the 2014 IPC (International Planning Competition) which was organised by Vallati, McCluskey and Chrpa, and attracted 86 entries (i.e. planning software) from all continents of the world, would not have been technically possible without the use of the School’s inhouse high performance computing facilities. Apart from the contribution to the discipline, this infrastructure provided the foundation for a huge amount of empirical investigation, resulting in a substantial article by the organisers in Knowledge Engineering Review 2018 and an earlier AI Magazine article that together have attracted well over 100 google cites by December 2020. The University’s Innovation Centre (the “3M BIC”) is housed opposite our Department's building and contains an Industrial Digital Technology demonstration laboratory. Lane, for example, has used this facility to support his ERA Foundation funded initiative, in collaboration with National Physical Laboratory staff, to engage with manufacturing SMEs to foster the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society Overview of Support for Collaborations  Collaborations in the widest sense are an essential ingredient in achieving all 5 of our research strategy’s objectives, where the Unit is seeking to rapidly raise its research profile nationally and internationally. Consequently, as well as winning direct external funding, we have at our disposal both Central University mechanisms and School mechanisms to help us deliver them. These collaborations range world-wide, are often interdisciplinary in nature, and often provide the basis for the academic and societal impact of the pioneering research undertaken within the Unit. Page 12  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Our School’s impact strategy is strongly aligned to the Unit’s overall strategy (c.f. obj-d in section 1). Its aim is to foster close collaboration with industry partners to accelerate knowledge transfer and the adoption of new technologies to deliver impact. This includes extensive support for the use of funded mechanisms such as KTPs, Innovate UK Collaborative R&D programmes (e.g. SMART grants). Seed-funding grants such as the CVF detailed in Section 2 are often used to lead to these larger collaborations, being the prime collaborations with research users (e.g. the PARK’s involvement in Urban Transport Management started using a University Collaborative Funding Voucher of £5000 and led to over a million pounds of investment in this area from Innovate UK and Venture Capitalist funding – more details are given in PARK’s Impact Case Study “New AI technologies for enriching and recovering value from urban data with applications to traffic management”). For collaborative support in general, the Unit has received: ?  Support for collaboration from the University Centre. URF is competitively obtained and is predominantly used to support collaborations. URF funds have been used for promoting interdisciplinary groups (e.g. CAIMH led by Antoniou detailed below), and for promoting international collaboration (e.g. the Robotics Centre led by McCluskey detailed below). For example, URF strand “Research Networking Fund” supports full-time and part-time postgraduate researcher visits to centres of research excellence.  ?  Support mechanisms for collaboration from the within School include use of support staff (described in the People section above), and the use of funding devolved from Quality Related income (for example research fellow Franco was funded via QR to support PARK’s Urban Transport Management research).  Exemplars of Collaboration - Academic Networks led by Unit Staff The EU-funded project Mirel (https://www.mirelproject.eu/) under the H2020 Marie Sklodowska Curie Research and Innovation Staff Exchange scheme in the area of AI for law, was led by Antonoiu as PI. The project was important in advancing the research agenda and state of mining and reasoning with legal texts and is currently producing a reference book on AI and Law. University of Huddersfield researchers visited institutions including University of Bologna, University of Luxembourg, CSIRO, Stanford University and Zhejiang University, and hosted international researchers and research students from China, Australia and Argentina. For example, Vallati visited the Universidad Nacional del Sur (Argentina), leading to a jointly written Scimago Q1 journal publication. Funded by Mirel, he also gave invited talks on knowledge engineering for AI Planning at the University of Tokyo, Japan (June 2019), and at Universidad Nacional del Sur, Argentina (July 2017). The EU-funded project Semdata www.semdata-project.eu/ under the FP7 Marie Curie International Researcher Exchange Scheme, in the area of semantic data management, with PI Antoniou, was important in advancing the research agenda and state-of-the-art of open data curation and quality, stream data querying and reasoning with big data. University of Huddersfield researchers visited international institutions such as Stanford University, Wright State University and RMIT, and hosted international researchers and research students from China, Australia and Ukraine. The COST European Network in “Autonomic Transport Support Systems” (TUD 1102, 2011 2015), chaired by McCluskey, had the participation of scientists from 24 European countries. Page 13  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Departmental staff and students participated through scientific visits and participation in workshops and competitions. The main outputs of the network were an edited, refereed book “Autonomic Transport Support Systems” published by Springer (DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-258089), two international competitions, two training schools, various focussed workshops, and 45 short term scientific visits. As an example of the latter, in June 2015, the Network funded Vallati to visit the TU Delft university in The Netherlands. The visit led to a number of subsequent publications, including one in the AAAI-2016 conference, and eventually led to a patent described below filed by SimplifAI Systems Ltd. University Research Funding supported the Department’s Robots Research Initiative [20142017] with £86,986 supporting a sequence of high profile international collaborations, underpinned by purchases of humanoid robots and support staff. The project funded the visit of Dr Tiago Vaquero from MIT/CalTech in June 2016 to collaborate on robot research; in 2015 Chrpa visited the Robotics labs at LSTS, University of Porto, and the Icelandic Institute of Intelligent Machines (IIIM), applying PARK’s expertise in Automated Planning to robotic applications. The visits led to joint publications, including a publication at the premiere robotics conference IROS, and joint Huddersfield - MIT organisation of the 2016 international competition ICKEPS [https://ickeps2016.wordpress.com/] at ICAPS 2016, London. Exemplars of Collaboration - Interdisciplinary Research led by Unit Staff Lane is Technical Coordinator for a Framework Research Collaboration Agreement with CERN. This has led to three PhD projects between CERN and CIndA, and a successful bid for EU ATRACT funding for €100k in total. He holds a Visiting Scientist post at CERN in the Beam Instrumentation Group in the Beams Department and works on novel opto-electronic sensing and associated signal detection and processing for the CERN accelerator complex. He is also the lead investigator of Huddersfield's association with the ATLAS experiment at CERN as a Technical Institute providing software, simulation and system design support to the trigger and data acquisition activity. Huddersfield is the first UK university to be accepted by ATLAS as a Technical Institute. Antoniou received support from the University Research Fund to drive interdisciplinary research across campus, with the aim of establishing an AI Institute. Based on this funding, he was able to reach out and establish a lasting working relation with South-West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. Co-funded initiatives between the University and Trust developed worldleading AI solutions in the areas of suicide risk assessment and adult ADHD diagnosis, while a new initiative started in 2020 towards developing an AI algorithm for diagnosing autism. Potential benefits include more accurate prediction of suicide and cost-effective decision support solutions for diagnosing ADHD and autism providing significant cost savings to the NHS through higher productivity per specialist clinician. These cost reducing effects are also the foundation for funding received by Research England through Grow MedTech towards possible commercialisation of the ADHD solution. McCluskey was PI and overall manager of the EPSRC project “Machine Learning and Adaptation of Domain Models to Support Real Time Planning in Autonomous Systems (EP/J011991/1 and EP/J011800/1, 2012 - 2016), collaborating with Prof Austin Tate of the University of Edinburgh, and Schlumberger at Schlumbeger-Gould research Centre at Cambridge. This was funded as part of the first tranche of the EPSRC/Industrial initiative in Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (2012-2017), aiming to create a sustainable world-leading Page 14  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) robotics and autonomous systems industry in the UK. It supported a network of nine projects across 16 universities. Industrial partners in the network were BAE Systems, Schlumberger, National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL), Sellafield Ltd, Network Rail, SCISYS, DSTL and the UK Space Agency. Many outcomes for Huddersfield followed including McCluskey’s further work with the DSTL on the future of autonomous agents (http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/31984/). As well as the above, the £1.8M ESIF grant “Smart Rolling Stock Maintenance” (2019-2023) detailed in Section 1 is a good example of such interdisciplinary research. Exemplars of Collaboration - Research Users and Societal and Economic Impact The Unit has won 5 Knowledge Transfer Partnerships since 2014, details of the most recent 4 follow: Impact via Knowledge Transfer Projects: - Axia Digital / Citizen Connect Ltd (PN-10103). This KTP led to the development of a new secure and customisable architecture for producing bespoke digital portfolio solutions, which are being used by clients with c.600k users worldwide. (PI: Parkinson) - Mainstream Measurements Ltd (PN-10565) This project culminated in the release of the Mainstream MODBUS communications adapter, which provides a secure communication interface for remote data acquisition, control, and integration. The contribution of the Associate (Sean Howson) to the project won the UK KTP’s 
``Future Innovator'' award in 2019 http://wateractive.co.uk/products/120k_rd_project_opens_up_markets_worldwide_for_wa ter_flow_measurement_company. (PI: Parkinson) - Valuechain.com (PN-11073). This three-year programme will provide the company with the capability to embed machine learning algorithms into its supply chain management software. Based on the KTP’s work, Valuechain have secured a new Innovate UK / Aerospace Technology Institute project in collaboration with Digital Catapult and Airbus. (PI:Crampton) - Brandon Medical (PN-10961) This joint work with our Department of Engineering Technology is aimed at improving product and service quality driven by the use of automation and data analytics in the manufacture of medical lighting and healthcare devices (Co-I: Hill). - Building on the sensing and data processing work carried out at CERN within CIndA, KTP has been won with Andel Ltd. This is yet to commence, but aims to develop a novel leak detection cable and associated signal processing to physically locate leaks across a wide range of scenarios including data centres and buried pipework. (PI: Lane) Impact Summary within Our Impact Case Studies PARK’s ICS (McCluskey et al) demonstrates impact with research users British Telecom, SMEs and Transport Authorities. CVV’s ICS (Xu et al) work in computer vision, visualisation, machine learning, and their software found extensive use in real-world tasks such as tracking and semantic segmentation. TAML’s ICS (Ward and Lu) shows that their iDea Portal and WRS technology has led to impact in educational settings across over 190 countries, including being used to teach the UK computing curriculum in schools. Collaborations and Societal Contributions in Health: Antoniou’s established collaboration with the NHS Foundation Trust (SWYPFT) referred to above, has led to AI solutions for adult ADHD diagnosis is being used in the clinical service of SWYT, and has received funding from Research England, through Grow Medtech (a Yorkshire Page 15  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) universities collaboration funded by Research England Connecting Capability Fund), towards possible commercialisation. Completed research and progress reports have been published in relevant journals and conferences in mental health (e.g. Crisis journal) and computer science (e.g. Applied Artificial Intelligence). Vallati established collaboration with the Hospital Policlinico Gemelli (Rome) and with the Brescia Hospital in the area of process mining for healthcare. This interaction led to a number of publications, and to the release of an R package called PmineR (http://www.pminer.info/progetti/website/main.php) that can be freely used for process discovery and conformance checking. Public Engagement: The UoA is committed to the Concordat for Engaging the Public with Research, with the University Centre providing an Engagement Fund for training in public engagement. Specific examples include: - Vallati uses his research expertise to write articles in Magazines such as The Conversation (https://theconversation.com/will-ai-take-over-quantum-theory-suggestsotherwise-126567) and in Academic blogs (http://blogs.hud.ac.uk/academics/2020/march/will-driverless-vehicles-take-over/). - McCluskey delivers a talk each year to local Schools based on his research in Autonomy entitled “From Self Driving Cars to Thinking Robots – the advent of Autonomous Intelligent Systems”. Wider public engagement by researchers has primarily been through formally organised events such as University European Researcher Nights in 2016 and 2017 (where over 3,000 members of the public attended the University for open events showcasing our research) delivering presentations and, more importantly, hands on activities. Researchers have also developed public lectures showcasing research in off-campus locations. These “Café Scientifique” events have proven popular and have been running since 2015 in conjunction with researchers from the School of Applied School Sciences. Contribution to the Research Base Keynote Talks Many staff in the unit have given external invited talks, below we list only some examples of Keynotes talks: Hill was Keynote Speaker for the 7th International Conference on Smart City and Informatization 2017: “Realising Smart Manufacturing with the Industrial Internet of Things”; Xu was Keynote Speaker for the 2017 International Conference on Sensing and Imaging, Chengdu, China, and Keynote Speaker for the 2016 International Workshop on Signal Processing with Applications in Scene Investigation. Lu has given several keynotes talks including “Big data vs. Environment - a Challenge in Both Areas”, International Conference on Change, Innovation, Informatics and Disruptive Technology, 2016, London, UK; the Fourth International Conference on Advanced Communications and Computation, France, 2014. Antoniou was Keynote Speaker at the 4th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics, Thessaloniki, Greece; ONTOBRAS 2015: Brazilian Seminar on Ontologies, Sao Paulo, Brazil; IISA 2019: Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications, Patras, Greece; PRICAI 2019: Pacifi Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Suva, Fiji; and WISE 2020: 21st International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

"Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Institution: University of Exeter Unit of Assessment: UoA11 Computer Science 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy Overview UoA11 is a vibrant research unit with a clear upward growth trajectory, having tripled in size since REF2014 to a headcount of 30 (27.9 FTE). A strong recruitment-drive over the census period has built on our areas of strength (Machine Learning, Evolutionary Computing and HighPerformance Computing) and added new groups in Cybersecurity and Urban and Environmental Data Science. These research areas, together with interdisciplinary initiatives in the University and beyond, tackle some of the most compelling questions that our society faces around the development and application of AI to address challenges in transportation, urban living and the environment, the transformative capability of 5G systems, the rise of social networks mediated by technology and methods to keep our systems and data secure. Current Unit Structure The unit currently consists of 30 staff (current positions: P=Professor, AP=Associate Prof., SL=Senior Lecturer, L=Lecturer) across the research groups described below: ? ? ? ? ?  Machine Learning and Computer Vision: Everson (P), Arribas (AP), Christmas (SL), Danon (SL), Ruan (SL), Costa (L), Dutta (L), Livi (L), Rowlands (née Shirazi) (L), Wahlstrom (L) Evolutionary Computing and Optimisation: Fieldsend (P), Keedwell (P), Li (SL), Moraglio (SL), Vaughan (SL), Alyahya (L), Chugh (L) High Performance Computing & Networking: Min (P), Wu (SL), Hu (SL), Luo (SL) Cybersecurity; Brucker (P), Marmsoler (L) Urban and Environmental Data Science: Menezes (P), Williams (AP), Arthur (L), Barbosa (L), Botta (L), Di Clemente (L), Oliveira (L).  Leadership and Decision Making The unit is led by Head of Department (HoD) Professor Ronaldo Menezes, supported by Directors of Research (DoR) (Keedwell), Education (DoE, Wakeling – Education Only Contract), Impact (DoI, Christmas) and Global Development (DoGD, Oliveira). Computer Science sits within the College of Engineering Mathematics and Physical Sciences, led by a Pro-Vice Chancellor. The Discipline Executive Committee (membership above) leads decision making at the departmental level and reports to the College Executive Group through the HoD. The DoR attends three-weekly, College-level Research and Impact Committee meetings chaired by the College Associate Dean for Research (ADR). This provides a forum for the sharing of information and best practice among departments. The ADR reports to the institutional-level Research and Impact Figure 1 - Research organogram Executive Group chaired by the Deputy-ViceChancellor for Research. The DoR is supported by the Academic Leads for each research group and the Directors of Postgraduate Research and Impact. This structure is summarised in Figure 1. Vision Our strategic goal is to become a global leader in applied computer science research, particularly in the development of novel Data Science, AI and advanced analytics methods for Page 1  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) application to complex social, urban, environmental, health, economic, and technological challenges. The growth in this REF cycle focused on broadening our research base resulting in a 180% increase in FTE and two new research groups. We now aim to achieve further growth to 35-40 FTE in the medium term, a size commensurate with the top-10 UoAs for Computer Science, with a focus on adding further depth to our current research profile. This growth will enable us to tackle interdisciplinary challenges at the boundary between machine learning and optimisation (e.g., hyper-heuristics), human-in-the-loop and explainable AI systems, softwaredefined networking in 5 and 6G networks, the changing patterns of human mobility, reduction of inequalities, and the development of data science methods to address climate change and environmental sustainability. The rigorous exploration of new methods in these areas will underpin the development of high performance, sustainable and explainable systems and will increase our understanding of the interactions between humans and their environment. These areas strongly align with institutional, national and international goals (e.g., the University’s Declaration of a Climate Emergency, UN Sustainable Development Goals) and represent some of the most challenging computational research areas of our times. We will accomplish the above through consistent and targeted growth throughout the next REF cycle, consolidating our current research groups adding depth to the broad portfolio that we have achieved in this REF cycle. The current profile of our UoA puts us in a strong position for targeted growth in the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Urban Systems, and Environmental Data Science. To achieve this, we will recruit staff to complement current research, leading to new ‘spin out’ groups from the current set once they achieve critical mass (e.g., Computer Vision from Machine Learning, Urban Analytics from the Urban and Environmental Group). This will allow us to take advantage of the many new strategic development opportunities (see Strategic Developments since 2014, below), and to create a larger-scale, vibrant research community, colocated in the newly refurbished building on the Streatham Campus that is now the dedicated home for Computer Science at Exeter. Progress Against REF2014 Strategy We have achieved our aim from 2014 to build new capability in HPC and Scientific Computing, predominantly through the creation of the HPC and Networking group under the leadership of Min. It consists of 4 core staff and 2 affiliates, 4 postdoctoral researchers and a growing number of PhD researchers, many of whom are industrially funded. With colleagues in Mathematics and the GW4 group of Universities, we (Fieldsend) received funding for Isambard, a novel architecture 10,000 core ARM-based HPC system based at the Met Office (https://gw4.ac.uk/isambard/), the first of its kind in the UK. This Tier 2 service has fostered collaborations with Mathematics (Wingate, Akman) on the development of new parallel-in-time codes for weather and climate modelling and models for systems biology. A University-level HPC governance group, led by Everson, has been established and oversees the procurement and management of the University supercomputer, Isca and the new research computing service (http://www.exeter.ac.uk/researchcomputing/). More recently, Everson has overseen the creation and recruitment of a Research Software Engineering group, part of a £975K University investment to provide support to researchers in the development of effective and efficient codes on the increasing array of architectures available to them. We further aimed to build new capability in bioinformatics and systems biology, leveraging the University’s £52M investment in the Living Systems Institute (see 1.3 & 4.16 Institutional Level Environment Statement (ILES)) and building on collaborations between Computer Science, Mathematics, Biology and the Medical School; this aim has also been met. The strategy has generated fruitful collaborations between computer scientists and mathematicians in the field of computational biology through EPSRC-funded research and joint publications (Fieldsend and Akman); work with the College of Medicine and Health (CMH) to explore AI in genomics (Keedwell); and COVID-19 research funded by the AFR (Keedwell) and MRC (Danon). Computer Science staff have also collaborated with colleagues in Biosciences and the CMH in pilot projects with the EPSRC Centre for Predictive Modelling in Healthcare (Keedwell, Fieldsend, Everson), resulting in interdisciplinary publications and research funding. Keedwell  Page 2  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) is also a panel member of the MRC Skills Development Fellowship Host Leadership team to evaluate projects that develop the computational skills of early-career biomedical researchers. Strategic Developments Since 2014 Through a dedicated, flexible approach to management, the unit has been able to make the most of the following new opportunities to build capacity and engage in interdisciplinary research underpinned by University, national and European investment: ? The creation of the University’s Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IDSAI, see 1.3 & 4.18 ILES). This interdisciplinary institute has a large core representation from the unit (Everson – Director, Barbosa, Botta, Costa, Danon, Di Clemente, Fieldsend, Keedwell, Livi, Luo, Menezes, Moraglio, Oliveira, Williams) and academic membership from across all University Colleges and campuses. It has provided access to new seed-corn funding streams (e.g., IDSAI research awards and Exeter-Turing pilot grants) and is a catalyst for interdisciplinary research across departments. IDSAI was founded in 2018 to develop innovative approaches to the use of data science and artificial intelligence in modern society and has rapidly grown to over 80 affiliated members of academic staff, and a wider membership of over 300 research staff. The Institute is the focus for the University’s membership of the Alan Turing Institute (ATI), hosting 25 Turing Fellows and enabling in excess of £3.4M of research income from Turing. IDSAI has instigated interdisciplinary MSc programmes, such as Data Science, Data Science with Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science for Health. ? The creation of the Environmental Futures and Big Data Impact Lab (Impact Lab) (£1.3M to the unit, see 1.11 ILES). This ERDF-funded initiative aims to stimulate impactful research and innovation through support from a team of industrial research fellows to enable local (Devon-registered) SMEs to leverage their data using research and knowledge transfer from the University, primarily from this UoA, supplemented by expertise and data from the Met Office. Researchers in the unit (Christmas, Costa, Everson, Keedwell) contribute their expertise to the planning and strategic direction of these projects, providing an excellent pathway to realising impact for the region. This activity has created 12 new businesses, developed 10 newto-market products and assisted the development of 10 new-to-firm products. It has also created 12 new jobs, has laid the foundations for follow-on Innovate UK funding worth over £2.5M to local business, and has supported product developments that have formed the basis of £1M+ funding cycles. For example, Everson and Costa’s work with Applegate began in the Impact Lab and has led to the development of a COVID-19 PPE supply hub. This facilitated the delivery of over 100 million items of PPE to businesses during the first lockdown and won a Tech South West ‘Hero Award’ in 2020.  ? Work on climate change and the environment has been identified as a strategic priority for the University and its regional collaborators through longstanding research collaborations with the Met Office. Computer Science has made a significant contribution to this through the award of the UKRI CDT in Environmental Intelligence (EI) in 2018. This £5.3M investment will train 50 PhD students over 8 years in the computational and data science methods required to allow informed decision-making by stakeholders for sustainable futures. An interdisciplinary CDT, it spans Mathematics, Management, Geography, Psychology, Philosophy and Medicine, with significant Computer Science involvement (Arribas, Everson, Williams (co-Director)). It benefits from strong industry involvement from partners AWS, Deepmind, IBM, Microsoft, ONS, Ordnance Survey, UKHO, the ATI, WHO, the Met Office and Exeter City Futures. ? Computer Science will also have significant involvement in the new, flagship, Joint Centre for Excellence in Environmental Intelligence (JCEEI), see 1.7 ILES, which cements Exeter’s pivotal strategic partnership with the Met Office through a pool of 20 new and repurposed research appointments drawn from both the Met Office and University. ? Membership of the Alan Turing Institute (ATI). Exeter was invited to join the ATI, the national institute for data science and AI, in 2018. Six members of the unit have been awarded Turing Fellowships (see Section 4) and Everson is the Turing University Lead. Through the Page 3  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Turing Institute we have engaged in new machine learning and data science projects and colead the ""Data Science for Sustainable Development: Environment, Climate, and Health"" project (Arribas, Everson) with Mathematics and the Medical School. Our membership has been instrumental in developing a new Operational Alliance between the ATI and the Met Office. On behalf of Turing, in a partnership with Alzheimer’s Research UK, Everson leads the analytics hub of the Early Detection of Neurodegenerative Disease initiative (EDoN). We have also benefited from participation in new interdisciplinary communities across the Turing network and have forged new connections with industry and the third sector. Collaboration with the Turing Research Engineering Group has been important in establishing the University’s centralised Research Software Engineering group. Finally, Turing membership has been critical for attracting new staff and many of our recent appointments have indicated their interest in Exeter due to our membership of the ATI. ? Participation in large national schemes including the £20M Institute of Coding. Although primarily an education initiative, Exeter has secured research funding for machine learning and networks research into visualising the changing jobs landscape; and for research into effective pedagogical methods for delivering Computer Science skills to non-Computer Science students. This venture is enhanced by the building of the South West Institute for Technology, located adjacent to the Computer Science building on Streatham campus, as part of a large national effort to provide the technical skills required by employers. Our involvement in the initiatives described above, strengthens our ability to engage in internationally excellent, interdisciplinary research, linked with the national Computer Science research and policy landscape, and demonstrates the growing influence of Exeter computer scientists. Through the above, it is clear that Computer Science at Exeter is embedded in the fabric of the South West, collaborating with local organisations (e.g., industry, catapults and LEPs) and delivering research, impact, skills development and education opportunities for people within the region. Our work often reflects the region’s unique economy, geography and demographics by: ? ? ? ?  Working with businesses that rely on the natural environment, through the EI CDT and UKRI-funded research with local water companies (Keedwell, Everson). Developing novel processing of photogrammetry images to bring new insight into local historical artefacts (Christmas). Working with local SMEs to increase the sustainability of buildings and transportation systems across the region (Everson, Fieldsend and Keedwell). Helping to develop the local economy through impactful research and knowledge exchange with local SMEs and startups (Impact Lab).  Strategy Beyond 2021 We aim to build on recent successes to increase our world-leading research in 5G/6G and cybersecurity; and to become a global centre of excellence in the development of data science and AI methods to address environmental and urban issues, underpinned by high quality infrastructure and world-class computing facilities. To accomplish this, we will continue to grow to create critical mass with commensurate increases in research indicators such as PGR students and research income. Further hires will strengthen our existing research groups and enable us to ‘spin-out’ groups in our areas of strength aligned with national strategic priorities in Computer Vision, Urban Analytics and Environmental Data Science; we also plan to expand capacity in the critical issue of detection of misinformation and disinformation, and further our AI portfolio towards human-AI systems. We aim to establish a new research group in Software Engineering, which will enable us to create new interdisciplinary partnerships with the AI (e.g., in search-based software engineering) and cybersecurity (
e.g., in engineering safe and secure software systems, software testing) groups. We will continue to extend our research support and management structures to accommodate these new groups and provide support for new staff and early career researchers. Each new group will have an academic lead to support all aspects of the research process including grant Page 4  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) writing and management, publication and impact activities, and to provide guidance on career progression through our performance development review process. Research Management Research Integrity and Open Access: 100% of Computer Science staff are ORCID-registered and researchers are expected to uphold the institutional principles of the Research Integrity Concordat (see 2.8 ILES) of honesty, rigour, transparency and open communication, care and respect, and accountability in their work. Colleagues are supported in this by the department’s academic lead and mentoring initiatives, the ethics committee and the DoR. New guidelines and information are disseminated through the regular staff meetings and annual research awaydays. Researchers are encouraged to publish their work as open access and non-compliant publications are identified and remedied quickly through staff consultation. Staff are signposted to University resources to cover article processing charges and in 2019, 10 such requests were made, up from 3 in the previous year. Support is provided centrally through the library, who proactively manage journal copyright requirements and deposits to our institutional repository, ORE. In 2019, the department exceeded 10,000 publication downloads through ORE and in the first six months of 2020, regularly exceeded 1,000 downloads per month. Open access principles are therefore embedded in the department as ‘business as usual’ and our work is clearly in demand through this channel. Impact: Researchers are encouraged to consider the potential impact from their research throughout the development of a project, from conception of an idea to the final stages of project delivery and beyond. This is facilitated through close collaboration with our Innovation, Impact and Business (IIB) service at the University, which provides support for all aspects of impact generation and business engagement. Staff are encouraged to engage industrial and other nonacademic partners in funding applications as a matter of course, ensuring that even fundamental research has a route through to impactful application. The success of this approach is evidenced through the award of 8 KTPs, 2 Innovate UK grants and 15 industrially-funded studentships and consultancy projects during the census period totalling £943,000 of industrial funding into the unit (see Section 4). Impact case studies were developed throughout the census period in partnership with IIB and the DoI, starting with a wide pool of potential studies and eventually focussing on the 3 strongest cases. The nominated 3 have arisen through distinct routes: from UKRI-funded research, Innovate UK funded research and from an industrial partnership, illustrating the diversity embedded in the selection process and in our mechanisms for generating impactful research. Interdisciplinarity: Computer Science has a strong history of collaboration with other disciplines, supported through activities at the departmental, College and University level, including the strategic developments described above. Researchers are encouraged to pursue interdisciplinary collaborations through the promotion of opportunities via e-mail, staff meetings and awaydays. The DoGD encourages multidisciplinary initiatives with international partners as part of the development of strategic partnerships (e.g., in China, Brazil, India - formalised through MoUs), in line with the institutional Global Strategy. The University’s College structure encourages interdisciplinarity as shown through particularly strong relationships with the Centre for Water Systems (Engineering) through the EPSRC WISE CDT (http://wisecdt.org.uk/) (Keedwell, Everson) and Computational Fluid Dynamics groups (Everson, Fieldsend); and with Mathematics colleagues in Systems Biology (Fieldsend) and Environmental Science (Everson). Figure 2 demonstrates the breadth of these collaborations across 14 separate University disciplines.

Seminars/Lectures Departmental seminars provide opportunities for researchers to discover the latest research findings from national and international researchers. All staff, postgraduate research students, and undergraduate students are encouraged to attend and to engage with the internal and external networking this provides. Seminars include an additional hour for coffee and discussion with the external speaker to promote networking and new idea incubation. During the COVID period, we have hosted live events on YouTube with leading international researchers on topics such as ‘Industry 4.0’, and the effect of the pandemic on female researchers. In recent years, we have also hosted a department-wide Christmas Lecture from an inspiring speaker on a topical Computer Science subject, including speakers from DeepMind, the Met Office, and most recently, an historian illuminating the work of Lovelace and Babbage. These events have proven popular with both staff and students, typically attracting over a hundred participants. IDSAI runs a parallel programme of seminars and a Christmas Lecture on data science topics, providing further engagement with researchers from around the University. Meetings/Awaydays The fortnightly staff meetings provide an opportunity to disseminate relevant research calls and to discuss operational items. Termly departmental meetings focus on strategic planning and consolidation of material. A termly College meeting disseminates College/University-level research strategies and targets within an interdisciplinary setting and provides an opportunity for researchers from the unit to meet with colleagues from the College and to celebrate collective research successes. Annual research awaydays provide an opportunity to reflect on progress during the year, to develop future research strategies, and involve workshop presentations on specific topical research items e.g., impact or open access.  Page 6  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Workshops Where an area of particular need is identified, workshops are arranged to provide additional support on particular topics throughout the year. One such example is our early-career grant writing workshop, which is run in conjunction with Research Services to provide guidance on developing ideas and applying for research funding for the first time. Other workshop series include ‘IIB Essentials’, a bi-annual event run by the IIB service that covers the development of impactful research through a set of themes: Supporting Research, Commercialisation, Spinouts and Start-ups, Intellectual Property and Commercialisation and Knowledge Transfer Partnerships. Conferences Since 2014, the department has hosted national and international conferences including the UK Computational Intelligence Conference in 2015, the 9th EAI International Conference on Big Data Technologies and Applications in 2018, the Environmental Intelligence Summit (170 delegates) in 2019 and the 11th International conference on Complex Networks in 2020 (CompleNet) (online due to COVID-19). The University supports academics in the organisation of conferences through professional services and events team support and the Support and Scholarship (S&S) time described below. 2. People Strategy The overarching aim for the department is to grow staff numbers to build research capacity in strategically important areas, encourage impactful activity and provide effective leadership to support world class research. We recognise the importance of aiming for a balanced portfolio of staff, both in terms of research area and seniority, and our recruitment since 2014 reflects that. We have successfully built on our research strengths and through our appointment and promotion strategy, have increased the number of senior staff in the department significantly. This has seen the number of Chairs increase to 6 (from 2 in 2014), APs from 1 to 4 (2 of whom subsequently became Chairs) and SLs from 2 to 5 during this REF cycle. As part of this process, a new, experienced HoD (Menezes) was recruited from the USA. He replaced Everson, who was appointed as Director of the IDSAI and University Turing Lead. Our strategy provides a pipeline for succession planning and future leadership to provide strategic direction to the unit and involves earlier career academics, who are encouraged to take on administrative roles at an appropriate career stage, providing departmental resilience and evidence for personal progression. Appointments Appointments are made according to the departmental strategy, which considers existing research strengths of the unit, the wider University and the national and international research landscape. They are made at the appropriate level, appointing at the professorial level where this leadership and vision is required, for example to establish new research groups. Examples of this are Min (HPC & Networking), Menezes (Urban and Environmental Data Science) and Brucker (Cybersecurity). Further appointments at Lecturer or SL (e.g., HPC & Networking - Hu, Luo, Wu; Urban and Environmental Data Science - Barbosa, Botta, Di Clemente, Oliveira; Cybersecurity - Marmsoler) are then used to build capacity and to support the internationallyexcellent research of the chairs, in addition to other appointments that strengthen existing research groups. Staff Promotion and Career Support The unit supports applications for promotion from staff and encourages all to apply as soon as they are considered to be at the appropriate level. Staff are encouraged to discuss their promotion case initially with their academic lead and subsequently with the head of department. Support is provided through the Exeter Academic scheme (see 3.3 ILES), which provides guidance on expectations for promotion for all career levels and academic job roles. This combination of local departmental support aligned with the University-level process has led to promotions at all levels throughout the department during this REF cycle: Page 7  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) AP->P – 2 (Keedwell, Fieldsend) SL->AP – 3 (Keedwell, Fieldsend, Williams) L->SL – 5 (Christmas, Li, Moraglio, Wu, Luo) General Staff within a research group are supported by an academic lead (AL), a senior academic within a similar research field, who supports and mentors members of staff in their research and career development. The AL role is an important way in which we democratise leadership roles and provide academics with a strategically important first point of contact for research mentoring. In addition to regular informal meetings, staff review performance annually with their AL through the performance development review process. This encompasses performance across the academic job role, identifies areas to be addressed and opportunities for the year ahead. These meetings, supported by performance metrics (e.g., research funding applications/awards), provide an important stock-check of performance, an opportunity to discuss progression and to develop research strategies for the coming year. In recognition of our increase in size and research diversity, our number of ALs has increased from 2 to 5 in order to provide appropriate and tailored mentorship to our academics. ALs will be allocated to each of the additional research groups described in our future strategic expansion. Through our workload planning system, staff are allocated 20% S&S time to devote to activities that enhance their research. This is in addition to time allocated to funded research, student supervision, education and administration activities and so provides valuable space for researchers to write funding applications and to contribute to the life of the discipline (see Section 4). Early Career Academics On appointment as lecturers, staff undergo an 18-month Academic Professional Programme (see 3.5 ILES), culminating in HEA membership, and receive specific support through ‘ramped’ teaching loads providing staged relief from education in the first three years. During this period, staff are encouraged to develop their collaborations within and beyond the University with academic and industrial partners and to develop applications for funding, such as for EPSRC First Grant/New Investigator Awards (NIA). To further facilitate this, ECRs are encouraged to engage in training mapped against the Researcher Development Concordat and the HR Excellence in Research charter (see 2.9 & 3.8 ILES). We also provide bespoke Computer Science training, explaining the research funding landscape and best practice in writing effective research proposals. Where an interview features as part of the assessment for a funding scheme, mock panels are convened with senior staff to provide applicants with experience of these challenging events. These initiatives have led to some notable ECR successes including EPSRC NIA awards for Pugeault (now at Glasgow) and Wu, and a prestigious £1M UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship award for Li. Postdoctoral Researchers We recognise that postdoctoral researchers (PDR) experience specific challenges in terms of the typically fixed-term contracts on which they are employed. Staff are encouraged to discuss these issues with their supervisors and we support PDRs in applying for appropriate funding (e.g. EPSRC and ERC Postdoctoral Fellowships) through ECR initiatives. Opportunities for training and gaining teaching experience are signposted to researchers through the induction process and supervisory channels. This has led to a significant proportion of our PDRs going on to become early-career academics, e.g., Chugh, Alyahya, Maxwell (Exeter), Walker (Plymouth), Rahat (Plymouth & Swansea), Kheiri (Cardiff & Lancaster). Staff Voice Staff (including PDRs) have the opportunity to co-develop departmental strategies though education and research awaydays and staff meetings. The leadership team actively encourage staff to challenge norms and contribute their ideas to departmental strategies. Each senior role has a 3-year term, providing opportunities for a range of individuals to contribute to the Page 8  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) development of the department and to enhance their leadership skills. Staff have multiple channels through which to voice any concerns, including staff meetings, performance development reviews, academic lead meetings, the institutional Staff Survey and annual ‘Pulse Checks’. In the most recent (2018) Staff Survey, 91% of Computer Science staff reported that they believe that the work they do makes a difference and that they have good relationships with their colleagues, underlining the collegiate culture that we have developed in the department. Early career staff also engage with the ECR Liaison Forums, through which they have formal strategic representation across the University. Issues arising from these channels are discussed and addressed at Executive Group Meetings, with new initiatives disseminated via staff meetings. Issues with harassment or bullying can be raised through an institution-wide network of Dignity and Respect Advisors and Speak Out Guardians (see 3.15 ILES), who work with the Vice-Chancellor’s Executive Group to identify trends or themes that arise from these cases. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Computer science has become a significantly more diverse department in this REF cycle, both in terms of ethnicity where the percentage of BAME staff has doubled from 24% in 2014/15 to 48% in 2019/20, and background where the proportion of staff 
from non-UK nations has increased from 35% to 55% over the same period. These figures justify our commitment to embed institutional EDI practices into our recruitment, training and promotion processes, adopting University procedure and best practice wherever appropriate. All staff involved in recruitment undertake recruitment and selection training, including on the avoidance of conscious and unconscious bias against those with protected characteristics. We align our research assessment processes with DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment), to which Exeter is a signatory (see 2.8 & 3.3 ILES), and outputs were selected for REF2021 through review by expert panel. All staff involved in the selection of outputs for the REF have undergone additional EDI training to ensure no bias is introduced into this process. In 2020, as the department achieved greater critical mass, we established an Inclusion and Diversity Committee responsible for establishing an EDI strategy for the unit together with the academic leads and is comprised of our Athena Swan Submission Author (Barbosa), Equality and Diversity Officer (Rowlands), Widening Participation Officer (Alyahya), and Ethics Officer (Arthur). They report quarterly to the unit Executive Group. Gender Balance Staff gender balance has traditionally been a challenge for the department and our submission was 100% male in REF2014. However, ongoing appointments have addressed this to a degree and we now have 3 female staff (Alyahya, Rowlands, Christmas) representing over 10% of research-active academic FTE. However, the proportion of REF submissions by female staff is lower than expected as two are very recent lecturer appointments (2020). Christmas achieved promotion to Senior Lecturer during the census period and now occupies a senior management role as our DoI, providing a role model for more junior female staff. Improved gender balance is evident in other areas of the department including teaching-only staff and in our PGR cohort, where almost 24% of applications and 30% of enrolments are female. However, we are continuing to develop measures to address our gender imbalance and we work with more balanced disciplines (e.g., Mathematics) to exchange ideas and best practice. This work has included two successful applications for Athena Swan Awards, where we became the first departments in the University to receive silver awards in 2016 and have recently been awarded a further bronze. We also engage with the College’s Workplace, Inclusivity, Diversity, Equality and Respect (WIDER) committee, which develops strategic direction and monitors progress against EDI goals (Barbosa, Keedwell, Christmas). Parental Leave Eligible staff are encouraged to apply for parental leave in line with University procedures (see 3.16 ILES). We are strongly supportive of staff who have parental and caring responsibilities. Staff are permitted to work flexibly and can apply to have specific hours in the week removed from consideration for teaching. A significant number of our staff make use of this, and 3 staff work 0.8 or 0.7 FTE to accommodate childcare responsibilities. These reduced hours are  Page 9  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) incorporated in our workload modelling and subsequently into individual workloads through the Executive Committee. Study Leave Academic staff are encouraged to apply for study leave (sabbatical) at the ratio of 1 year in every 7 (pro-rata for shorter periods) to expand their research, collaborations and impact. Due to our rapid growth, relatively few members of staff have become eligible for a full year but Fieldsend (2013-2014) and Keedwell (2015 & 2019) have taken a year, and Danon completed 6 months leave in December 2020, in part to assist SAGE on COVID-19 modelling through membership of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M). Williams has approved leave for 2020-21, currently postponed due to COVID. Research Students PGR numbers have increased substantially over the census period, increasing 50-60% year on year from 11 in 2014 to 40.5 in 2018/19, resulting in a PGR/FTE ratio of 2.13. A PGR cohort of this size enables a vibrant research-led culture within the department with students contributing to and benefitting from departmental seminars and meetings and events organised by the department’s PGR coordinator. The supervisor-weighted completion rate for students in Computer Science during the census period was 20.3, with 26 students completing during this time. This might seem low in comparison with our FTE, but is a function of our growth: mean PGR registrations during the census period were 28.2 and mean staff FTE was 15.8, indicating a healthy ratio over the REF cycle. Recruitment, Support and Facilities We adopt similar processes, norms and expectations to the recruitment of postgraduate students as to the recruitment of staff. The unit has successfully recruited students using a range of funding sources including College, DTP, CDT and industrial funding, indicating that this growth is sustainable in the long term. For most new appointments, a College-funded PGR student is included in the start-up package. The unit aims to provide an inclusive, stimulating and impactful research environment for our postgraduate students, which includes access to excellent facilities and high-quality supervision. At the University level, students are supported by the Doctoral College, which stimulates and supports a vibrant research and intellectual environment across disciplines for postgraduate and early career researchers and PGR liaison groups provide the students with a voice to express concerns that cannot be resolved at the departmental level. Students are largely homed in a bespoke refurbished space in the new Computer Science building, close to academic staff, and are provided with funds for equipment, travel and consumables. Skills training is provided through central researcher development network modules and a Masters-level Research Methodology module. Students are encouraged to ‘audit’ (attend without compulsory assessment) taught modules specific to their studies at the supervisor’s discretion. Assessment Students are assessed via report and mini-viva by two academics, one external to the supervision team, at 6-months, and then annually throughout their studies to receive external feedback and ensure consistent progress. This provides the student with experience of a vivalike setting, feedback on their progress and ideas to take forward. This external assessment also provides opportunities to raise any concerns regarding supervision and we encourage postgraduates to voice their concerns through this channel, through their supervisor if appropriate and via the PRES (The Postgraduate Research Experience Survey). Arising issues are either addressed locally or elevated to the Executive Group where a departmental-wide response is merited. In addition, students are required to present their work, at least annually, to their research group, a requirement that is supplemented in the unit by a postgraduate research event co-located with research awaydays and/or the College postgraduate conference. These two events provide a  Page 10  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) valuable forum for the dissemination and exchange of research ideas and outcomes among PGRs. An exciting development for the unit was the award of an AI Centre for Doctoral Training in Environmental Intelligence, which commenced in September 2019. It promises to provide significant numbers of new postgraduate opportunities in this important research area and will benefit the entire UoA11 PGR cohort through new infrastructure and resources and opportunities for interdisciplinary training and industrial engagement, as well as providing significant numbers of new postgraduate opportunities for our unit. 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities Income The unit has attracted significant income from a wide variety of sources, including the Research Councils (predominantly EPSRC and NERC), Innovate UK, EU, charities and industry. Total research income during the census period was £6.95M, a greater than five-fold increase over the REF2014 census period (£1.29M). A proportion of this is expected due to increases in average FTE over the two periods (REF2021=15.8, REF2014=8.5). However, staff growth explains only £1.11M of the £5.66M uplift in research income. This significant increase clearly indicates a transformational shift in our ability to attract research funding, particularly for larger bids, and our ability to write high quality, exciting and timely grant proposals. Our strategy has been to empower staff to apply for grants commensurate with their career stage, for example by supporting study leave applications for all those applying for fellowships and larger grants and providing relief from teaching for new starters. These initiatives are underpinned by a departmental-wide six-point approach to achieving high quality grant applications: 1. Promotion of funding opportunities at staff, departmental and College meetings and research awaydays. 2. Strong support in bid development through the academic lead system. The academic lead is involved in the early stages of idea generation and bid preparation and signposts researchers to University services. 3. End-to-end support from Research Services and IIB to provide partner engagement, administrative support, and to ensure that bids are costed appropriately. 4. Departmental workshops and monthly writing clubs, aimed at early career researchers, to enable the sharing of best practice among staff. 5. Implementation of a peer-review process that provides independent feedback from senior academics at key stages in the application process. 6. Leveraging of match funding from the College to increase resources for applications (e.g., an additional research studentship), particularly for early career awards. This democratised approach has resulted in income spread across the department and at all seniority levels. During the census period, 15 separate staff have worked as investigators on funded research projects spread across 33 different funders including UKRI, EU, Alan Turing Institute, RAEng, Royal Society and a wide range of industrial partners. Notable awards include (Funded amount to the UoA shown): ERDF: Environmental Futures and Big Data Impact Lab: £1.35M, Everson UKRI: Future Leaders Fellowship Scheme: £1.0M, Li EPSRC: Keedwell: £354K, Fieldsend: £300K, Christmas: £288K NERC: Everson, Fieldsend, Luo: £459K Innovate UK: Fieldsend: £262K, Keedwell: £188K, Everson: 2x £111K US Army Research Office: Menezes: £130K These awards have been underpinned by a host of smaller awards from other funders as described above.  Page 11  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Strategy Our strategy is to continue to build on this success and to ensure that the implementation of the initiatives described above continues and is further embedded into departmental culture. Through the expanded AL system, we aim to provide research-area specific support to staff of all levels to develop novel ideas into concrete, high quality proposals. We recognise our interaction with industry as a strength and will continue to develop our relationships with industrial partners and to engage with large-scale schemes such as the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund. A further challenge to the research funding landscape is the increase in call-based funding opportunities with short turnaround times. To address this, a pipeline of ideas is maintained to provide a pool of potential proposals that can be adapted for these calls. Furthermore, we remain vigilant to new opportunities through web and e-mail announcements, our memberships of various national and regional forums, and our own funder advisory networks (e.g., EPSRC FAN - Keedwell). Infrastructure and Facilities Physical Infrastructure Computer Science is located in a newly refurbished home on the Streatham Campus, Innovation Centre Phase 1. A strategic decision was taken to move to this building to provide a single home for the department, with the attendant benefits to the research environment from Computer Science researchers being co-located in a single facility. The building has undergone a £1.1M repurposing that has seen the creation of new offices and open-plan workspaces for 70 academics, PDRs and PhD students within a purpose-built environment. These workspaces are located alongside break-out rooms, kitchen facilities and two undergraduate teaching labs, named Lovelace and Babbage by a department-wide popular vote. These improvements have created a home for Computer Science and have raised capacity to 191 spaces for academics, PDRAs and PhD students, providing room for the department to expand in-line with our growth strategy. There are further plans for researchers and PGRs from IDSAI to be co-located with the Global Systems Institute (GSI) and Astrophysics, providing opportunities for interdisciplinary research, particularly around the Environmental Intelligence theme. Computational Resources Researchers can make use of a variety of resources within the department and at the University and regional level. Locally, a significant volume of work is conducted on workstations purchased as part of research projects. However, larger facilities exist at the research group level with specifications tailored for specific research areas, e.g.: Everson: 12-machine Xeon CPU Linux Cluster Fieldsend: Tesla k40 GPU servers Wu: NVIDIA Titan RTX GPUs workstations (funded by an EPSRC Equipment Award) Menezes: 22-core Xeon Server, 515Gb of RAM, 80Tb of storage, RTX 2080Ti GPU Researchers in Computer Science also have access to two local HPC facilities that have attracted over £10M of investment in the census period: ISCA and Isambard, described below. ISCA ISCA is a £3M University HPC facility designed to serve advanced computing requirements for all research disciplines, combining a traditional HPC cluster with a virtualised cluster environment. ISCA is available free of charge to all research groups and consists of a range of computer resources within a single machine: the traditional cluster (128 GB nodes) is complemented by two large memory (3 TB) nodes, Xeon Phi accelerator nodes and GPU (Tesla Page 12  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) K80) compute nodes. The non-traditional element of ISCA includes a cluster of higher memory nodes (256 GB), 3 TB nodes, and an Openstack environment for the management of virtualised resources. Academics are encouraged to cost in the use of this facility into research grants to support computational work. The unit (Brucker and Keedwell) has recently received an £85K EPSRC Core Equipment Award for x86 (56-core, 768GB) and IBM POWER9 (2x20-core CPU, 4x V100 GPU) nodes to bolster research in the cybersecurity and AI fields. Isambard (https://epsrc.ukri.org/blog/isambardhpc/). We are members of the GW4 consortium that successfully bid for the £3M EPSRC Tier 2 Computing centre based at the Met Office. This system is made up of over 10,000 64-bit ARM cores representing a novel architecture for research. During the census period, significant use (~301,000 core hours) has been made of this by Computer Science researchers for the optimisation of CFD models. Further funding has recently been granted for Isambard 2 (EP/T022078/1), which will use cutting-edge A64fx processors. Operational Infrastructure Computer Science is led by the HoD who chairs an Executive Group consisting of the DoR, DoI, DoE and DoGD. The DoR, (Keedwell) is the primary contact for research-related matters and works with Research Services and IIB to support researchers in grant writing, peer review, grant management, output nomination and impact development. He is responsible for the promotion of research activities within the department and liaises with other related administrative roles such as the Director of Postgraduate Research, the Seminar and Event Organiser and the Academic Leads. The DoR has a budget (typically £5-7.5K annually) to support research, providing the opportunity to pump-prime projects that have yet to be externally funded and to support visits to industrial partners or academic conferences, predominantly for ECRs who have limited 
access to funding. As discussed in Section 1, the DoI (Christmas) manages impact activities and cultivates impact case study development, and the DoGD (Oliveira) fosters international connections. Researchers are also supported by dedicated contacts in Research Services (Roberts) to assist with the costings and development of proposals, particularly impact and justification of resources sections, and in IIB (Gonzales) to encourage engagement with industrial partners and to promote industrial funding opportunities. 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society To achieve our goal to become a global leader in applied computer science research a strong set of partners and collaborators from across sectors is necessary. We have already developed a rich ecosystem of applied and interdisciplinary research collaborations (both internal and external), broad industrial engagement and societal impact, and we plan to extend its reach both geographically and into important new sectors. This ecosystem is described in more detail below, along with metrics of esteem such as fellowships, prizes, and our contribution to the research base through grant reviewing activities. These activities are promoted through the 1 day per week of S&S time for academic staff described earlier. Non-Academic Collaborations Every member of the unit makes a significant contribution to the research base, economy and society. They achieve impact from their research through collaboration with non-academic partners, co-creation of funding applications, student co-supervision, co-authorship of publications and invited talks, grouped into the following broad thematic areas: Environment & Sustainability Core to the Environment and Sustainability theme is our strategic partnership with the Met Office, realised through joint appointments (Arribas), the JCEEI and the Impact Lab (see Section 1). Everson leads the Impact Lab and has played a pivotal role in the projects described, along with Christmas, Costa and Keedwell. To date, the unit has worked with 12 partners in this sector: City Science, RegenFarm, OTA Water, Emtec, Floor Dynamics, Thermancy , Milkalyser, Seiche, Page 13  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Spatial Quotient (formerly That Figures), Minibems, Applegate and FuturebE. These have led to KTPs for Everson (Applegate) and Christmas (That Figures). Further ongoing work in this theme includes engagement with the Flood Forecasting Centre (Williams, Arthur), Global Hazard Map and TIST (Arthur). We work closely with the water industry and have gained funding for projects on machine learning with South West Water (1 studentship and 1 KTP, Everson), DC Welsh Water (KTP, Keedwell), United Utilities (studentship, Keedwell) and Hydro International (Fieldsend); and a KTP with Artesia Consulting (Everson), which developed new data science tools for leakage management. We are also involved in UKRI-funded interdisciplinary projects that involve wide industry engagement, such as the HOWS project (Keedwell) investigating interactive evolutionary methods for designing and managing water systems, with Bristol Water, WSP, AECOM, SEAMS and SWW. Optimisation and machine learning for sustainable planning and development has underpinned our Innovate UK-funded collaborations with City Science (totalling £2M; Everson, Fieldsend & Keedwell) and Hoare Lea (Everson, Fieldsend), and a KTP with BEST Energy Saving (Everson and Christmas). Technology  We work with telecoms providers including BT, with whom we have 3 funded PhD studentships including an iCASE (Min, Luo, Keedwell), and a further 3 with a large telecoms company held by Min (confidential). Everson has also received 3 funded PhD studentships in partnership with Engineers’ Gate on data science in FinTech and Keedwell has an iCASE with Dyson working on AI and privacy. We have ongoing collaborations with Samsung (Wu), Google (Barbosa), Nokia Bell Labs (Menezes), DeepMind, AWS and Microsoft (Arribas), IBM and IBM Research (Arthur, Everson, Hu, Luo & Williams), Ericsson (Hu), Adarga (Williams), Sony CLS (Di Clemente) GE Healthcare (Li) and Cambridge Mobile Telematics (Wahlstrom). Fujitsu have funded significant periods of consultancy and contract research and have an approved patent with Moraglio. Defence (esp. Marine)  Partnerships in this sector are a particular focus for Christmas, who works closely with a range of organisations including the MoD, Qinetiq, BMT and BAE Systems. During the census period, she worked with the MoD and BAE Systems as part of an EPSRC Prosperity Partnership. Menezes is funded by the USA Army Research Office (ARO) in the understanding of human mobility patterns. ARO have visited the University and demonstrated interest in continuing funded research with Barbosa, Menezes & Keedwell. Government/Policy/Charity  Danon works for SPI-M carrying out COVID-19 mathematical modelling for SAGE. He has received funding from Pfizer and serves on their academic advisory panel. Botta has worked on data science projects with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Government office for Science, Cabinet Office and ONS, and Arthur works with the Health and Safety Executive. Barbosa has applied his urban data science tools with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USA) and Di Clemente has worked with the Gates Foundation, the World Bank and UN data pulse on data science projects. Menezes works with UNICEF and hosted one of their research scientists which led to activities in other Colleges. Spin Outs Social Sensing: An early-stage spin-out that uses social media to map extreme weather and climate events (Williams & Arthur directors). They are currently working with the Environment Agency Flood Forecasting Centre, where their app is providing flood monitoring and retrospective flood forecast verification services. The company is in talks with other meteorological organisations, such as Global Hazard Mapping unit at the Met Office.  Page 14  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Government agencies (such as DFT) and various companies in the insurance sector have also expressed interest. CAFlood is a commercial venture arising from EPSRC-funded research in the simulation of flooding using cellular automata (Keedwell), that has generated licencing and contract research revenues of ~£65K to date and is the subject of an impact case study. It has been employed by local and national government agencies, councils, insurance companies and the water sector internationally to model and simulate various flood scenarios. It has underpinned a £3M+ Torbay flooding infrastructure award, Thames Water’s £247M maintenance programme, influenced national flood risk policies (NaFRA2) and has been applied to flood protection systems safeguarding millions of people globally (e.g., Taipei City’s early flood warning system). Societal Impact During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have responded quickly to address needs in the local and national community. Danon received funding to predict the spread of COVID-19 in the UK and evaluate the impact of quarantine restrictions, helping to inform local and national government response. Everson and Costa developed the award-winning COVID-19 supply hub described in Section 1, and Keedwell received funding to develop clinical scorecards for COVID-19 patients incorporating viral load measures. Our academics were also involved in broad cross-institutional initiatives to model the pandemic through RAMP (Royal Society) and DeCOVID (ATI). Further societal impacts have been achieved through CAFlood (Keedwell), which informed national flood risk policies; the Impact Lab (Everson, Christmas, Costa, Keedwell), which led to the creation of 12 new local jobs and businesses; and collaborative work with DCWW (Keedwell) applying machine learning to sewer maintenance strategies, reducing sewer blockages by 31%, household flooding incidents by 16% and operational costs by £2M and thereby reducing impact and costs for 3M customers (also an impact case study). International Research Collaborations The unit has strong research collaborations across the globe, developed and promoted through the DoGD who encourages unit participation in institution-level initiatives (e.g., strategic relationships with Universities of Queensland and Fudan) and the development of unit-level global collaborations, of which there are 77 across 6 continents, as shown in Figure 3. These include visiting professorships, co-development of funding applications, research project collaboration and co-authorship of publications, among others.  Figure 3 - International collaborations by country  Page 15  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Academic Esteem and Contribution to the Life of the Discipline UoA11 staff have received significant recognition both nationally and internationally as evidenced by the range of fellowships and prizes awarded below and have been invited to review applications for a wide range of funders. They have also contributed over 90 times as conference, programme and workshop chairs and 50 times as journal editors, associate editors and guest editors across conferences and journals in the cybersecurity, networking, HPC, AI, ML and urban systems fields during the census period. These activities are encouraged as a method of contributing to the life of the discipline and for personal development, supported by the 20% S&S allocation. Fellowships Arribas, Danon, Everson, Williams, Pugeault, Roussos were appointed Alan Turing Institute Fellows in 2018, consolidating our links with this important national institute. Dutta and Di Clemente received Marie-Curie (2017-2019) and Newton International (2017) fellowships respectively during the early stages of their careers, increasing their research potential and widening their networks. Livi was appointed as a Canada Research Chair in 2019, a scheme that aims to “attract and retain some of the world’s most accomplished and promising minds.” Also in 2019, Li was appointed as a UKRI Future Leader Fellow which aims to “develop the next wave of world-class research and innovation leaders in academia and business.” Prizes Research excellence has been recognised by a variety of prizes awarded during the census period. Hu and Williams have won best paper prizes at IUCC14, IEEE SOSE16 and ICWSM 2016 and Keedwell won 2nd best student paper at CCWI 2016. Staff have also been recognised by their professional bodies with Brucker awarded Senior Member status of the ACM in 2015 and Min receiving an Award for Excellence from the IEEE TCSC in 2017. Evidence of excellence in impact is evidenced by Arribas’ - UK IT Industry RITA Award “Best Innovation in Technology” 2017 / Runner up Best Innovation in Civil Service 2016 and Luo’s 2018 Scottish Knowledge Transfer Award from the Scottish Funding Council. Grant Reviewing Activity and Membership of Selection Panels Membership of grant review and selection panels are an important measure of esteem and allow us to make a significant contribution to the life of the discipline. Botta (2016-) and Brucker (2015-) are members of the EU ERC/Horizon 2020 review committee and Brucker (2017-), Everson, Keedwell (2013-) and Min (2006-) are members of the EPSRC Review College, whilst Hu and Wu are members of the EPSRC Associate College. We have also contributed to ad-hoc reviewing of UKRI AI Acceleration and FLF schemes, EPSRC, BBSRC, MRC, Marsden Fund, Marie Sk?odowska-Curie, Royal Society, and Leverhulme Trust reviews through Everson, Danon, Keedwell, Min and Moraglio. Internationally, staff have conducted reviews for REPRISE (Italy- Di Clemente), NFST (Chile – Menezes), NRF (South Africa – Keedwell, Fieldsend), FFG (Austria), SNSF (Switzerland) and ANR Doctoral Contracts (France) (Keedwell).  Conclusion Collectively, these sections describe a young and vibrant department, engaged in impactful research connected with the wider international community and making significant contributions to the life of the computer science discipline across the globe.

"Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Institution: University of Cambridge Unit of Assessment: 11 - Computer Science and Informatics  1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy 1.1 Context This Unit of Assessment is essentially the Department of Computer Science and Technology – a world-class research facility combining theory with practical activities, and significantly advancing both the field and computing in the wider world. The Department sustains active research across the breadth of computer science and encourages the development of new technologies and applications. Key elements of the Department’s ethos are our focus on impact, and openness to working closely with both academic and non-academic organisations. Our activities are formally overseen by the Faculty Board and the Degree Committee (whose Chair and some members are external to the Department.) The Department occupies a single purpose-built facility. We strive to be a single coherent community with an open environment where all academics, research staff and students can contribute to discussion of topics affecting the Department. Over 260 people are engaged in research here. On the census date, the Department employed 54 permanent academic 1 staff – an increase of 13 since the last REF – and 110 contract research staff (an increase of 26), and also accommodated 3 research fellows funded by colleges and other agencies. Sixty of the research staff were employed on HESA Category A contracts, and 28 of these were identified as independent researchers. We’ve been able to attract a large pool of excellent candidates for new positions, even in highly competitive areas – e.g., receiving 128 applications for a Lecturer/Senior Lecturer position in Machine Learning and subsequently being able to appoint three new staff. Several new appointees have joined from industry (see section §1.4). The new permanent staff include seven women and gender balance in this period has improved at all levels (see §2.4). PhD student numbers are at 100 and increasing rapidly, with over 50 new students in the academic year 2020-21 (see §2.3). These figures reflect a strong increase in research funding coming from more diverse sources (see §3.1). As discussed below, and in §1.3.3, an increasing proportion of our research is interdisciplinary. One notable strength is the Department’s range of highly impactful long-term research projects such as CHERI*2, a 10-year processor architecture security technology project that is now at the centre of the £187 million Digital Security by Design cybersecurity programme with investment from the UK government and major industrial players. Another is the diversity of pathways to impact (see §1.4.) from spin-outs (e.g., from the Unikernels* research) to online learning platforms (e.g., Isaac*) to Iris recognition* technology being incorporated into international standards and used by international government agencies during its global deployment.  1.2 Structure We classify research undertaken here by themes – i.e., research specialisms – and application areas like ‘Education’ and ‘Health’, which involve collaborations between researchers from this Department and other disciplines and/or external organisations. 1 Including Emily Shuckburgh who is a member of this Department but for the purposes of the REF is being returned by UoA 7. 2 Starred Names* denote impact case studies.  Page 1  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Themes centre on the methodologies and technologies employed in research. They are: • • • • • • • • • •  Algorithms & Complexity: application of logic to computational complexity, the design and analysis of algorithms. Computer Architecture: CPUs, accelerators, interconnect, memory hierarchy, SW/HW codesign. Graphics, Vision & Imaging Science: interpreting, creating, and animating visual data. Human-Centred Computing: affective computing, human factors, design, HCI. Machine Learning (ML) & Artificial Intelligence (AI): foundational ML methods, data science. Mobile Systems, Robotics & Automation: IoT, wearables, robotics, sensors and sensor networks. Natural Language Processing: computational linguistics, algorithms and machine learning approaches adapted to language and text. Programming Languages, Semantics and Verification: automated reasoning, compilers, foundations, logic and programme analysis Security: privacy, security, cryptography, cybercrime. Systems & Networking: distributed systems, databases, wireless, operating systems, virtualisation.  The Department has significant strengths in all these, but is most notable for its consistent success in bringing researchers from different themes to work together – e.g., in the following application areas where we have large ongoing projects and activities: • •  •  Security by design. The REMS* and CHERI* projects involve world-leading expertise from the Computer Architecture, Programming Languages and Security themes using full hardware-software co-design, as well as formal modelling and proof. Education. The ALTA Institute (part of the Text prediction and feedback* impact case study) is a product of our work in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. In collaboration with the Department of Engineering, Linguistics and Cambridge Assessment, it is improving educational technology for English language learners. Mathematics both underlies much of the Department’s research and is an important application area. The Algorithms & Complexity and Programming Languages, Semantics and Verification themes, in collaboration with the University’s Centre for Mathematical Sciences, both use and create new results in mathematical logic and category theory, such as in Glynn Winskel’s ERC ECSYM project. Lawrence Paulson’s3 ERC ALEXANDRIA project aims at large-scale formal proof for the working mathematician via modern verification technology, such as the Isabelle/HOL interactive theorem prover.  Themes describe the Department’s activities externally. Internally, activities fall within research groups. These provide structure for postdoctoral staff and PhD students – e.g., by organising specialist seminars, and running feedback sessions for draft papers – and influence decisions such as space allocation. The main changes in research structure during this REF period arose from strategic decisions to build capacity in key areas where computer science has potential for huge societal impact. One is environmental science, long an important area here – as evidenced by ‘Computing for the Future of the Planet’, Andrew Hopper’s 2017 Royal Society Bakerian Prize-winning research initiative. We made two interdisciplinary appointments in 2019: Emily Shuckburgh from the British Antarctic Survey as Reader in Environmental Data Science and Srinivasan Keshav as Robert Sansom Professor of Computer Science, to work broadly on using computer science techniques and technologies to encourage the adoption of renewable energy and combat climate change. Shuckburgh is Director of Cambridge Zero, the University’s climate change initiative, and PI and CoDirector of AI4ER, the Cambridge UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in the Application of Artificial 3 Names in bold denote staff we are submitting. We also give their first name on initial mention.  Page 2  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Intelligence to the study of Environmental Risks. Keshav and Damon Wischik are Deputy Directors of AI4ER. There has also been concerted expansion in Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS). Significant efforts by both Heads of Department (Hopper to May 2018, and then Ann Copestake) secured a donation from DeepMind to fund a Chair of Machine Learning. This enabled us to make a key appointment (Neil Lawrence), which helped us attract other new staff. Overall, we have recruited six people with expertise in these areas since 2016 (Wischik, Shuckburgh, Lawrence, Carl Henrik Ek, Ferenc Huszar, Nicholas Lane); five of these are new positions. The new expertise complements the work of existing staff already well established in this area (especially Sean Holden, Pietro Liò, Mateja Jamnik and others). A particularly strong emerging feature of the Department is the focus on ML/DS as an integral part of computer science, including systems (Lane, Lawrence), programming (Andrew Rice) and computer architecture (Robert Mullins). This complements the work of other research groups in the University, particularly the internationally-acclaimed Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence group in Information Engineering, with whom we have strengthened ties through joint involvement in projects. A major part of our strategy involves collaboration with other disciplines to enhance their research by using cutting-edge ML/DS techniques – as we are doing in a Mark Foundation Institute for Integrated Cancer Medicine initiative involving Liò and Jamnik, that uses advances in machine learning to integrate diverse breast cancer patient data and derive insights from it. (This is in collaboration with Cambridge University Hospitals Department of Oncology and the University Department of Radiology.) We recently obtained substantial funding from Schmidt Futures for our new ‘Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery’ to equip researchers with the skills they need to use ML in their research. Similarly, this Department is a hosting partner of AI4ER and eight of the ten inaugural students who started their PhD in 2019 are supervised or co-supervised by academic staff here. Such activities align with another of our strategic recruitment objectives, to increase our interdisciplinary work (see §1.3.3).  1.3 Research Strategy The Head of Department (HoD), Deputy Heads and Research Strategy Manager have overall responsibility for the strategic development of research, in consultation with the University School of Technology. The process is highly consultative: relevant research-related matters are discussed at weekly term-time staff meetings, involving all REF Category A staff and the more senior professional services staff. There are occasional structured meetings to explore particular issues more widely, and an annual offsite meeting. 1.3.1 Review of research plans described in REF 2014 1. Expand the academic staff by four over the period 2013-2018. In fact, we expanded from 41 to 54 staff by the end of the REF period (see §2) in order to maintain a broad range of research and stay internationally competitive, supported by success in obtaining funds, including via the ERC and the Alan Turing Institute. 2. Expand support functions, particularly the finance office. This plan was modified because we saw the need to create a broader Research Strategy Team to support all aspects of research, not just financial. (See §1.3.2.)  Page 3  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) 3. Start planning towards a new building for 2020 onwards. This is the only plan not yet to have succeeded, for reasons discussed in §1.3.4. 4. Smooth out the cluster of 2020 retirements by using reserves to recruit early to some of these posts. We have increased staff numbers as well as recruiting early. 5. Further diversify funding and increase industrial engagement. Our successful diversification and increase in funding is described in §3. Growth in industrial engagement is described in §4. 1.3.2 Strategic planning after REF 2014 To supplement the usual planning processes described above, in September 2018 the Department underwent a Strategic Research Review (SRR) with an external panel, chaired by Marta Kwiatkowska (University of Oxford) and including panellists from Carnegie Mellon University, UCL, the University of Austin at Texas and Nokia Bell Labs. This was purposely timed to take place shortly after Copestake took over as HoD. The SRR identified several priorities, including: •  •  •  Communication and Support. The panel recommended establishing a communications role here – to highlight the Department’s successes to funders and society at large and raise the profile of the quality and scope of research here – and recruiting more academic-related staff “to lessen the administrative workload of academic and professional services staff”. Culture. “Carefully manage the impact of any further growth on the Department’s internal culture. Foster early collaboration and communication between faculty and PhD students and reflect on the integration process… in order to ensure the satisfaction and well-being of its graduate student population.” PhD funding. The panel suggested we optimise the return from industrial links to fund studentships.  The Communication and Support priorities extended our existing plan 2 (see above) to expand the finance office. This led to the establishment of a Research Strategy Team, headed by the Research Strategy Manager, which currently has five staff (2.8 FTE) and is still growing. Internally the team supports many aspects of grant applications (see §3.3). Externally, its functions include communications, managing an association for industrial supporters – the Supporters’ Club – and another for alumni, the Cambridge Ring (see §4.4.). Generally, the SRR made positive comments about Departmental culture, including highlighting the collaboration between groups, and intellectual freedom. Their recommendations about the integration of postgraduate students led us to introduce more structure to student induction (see §2.3). 1.3.3 Interdisciplinary Research Since the last REF period, we have focused on expanding interdisciplinary activities to help extend the impact of our research. We achieved this through appointing new academic staff who have strong interdisciplinary links or come from different disciplines. • • • • •  Paula Buttery, a computational linguist, now leads the ALTA Institute, a key demonstration of the importance of the multidisciplinary approach to language learning and assessment. Alice Hutchings has a background in criminology and is Deputy Director of the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre, which combines expertise from computer science, criminology and law. Keshav’s conservation focus is discussed above. Lawrence leads the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. Shuckburgh, a mathematician, climate scientist and Director of Cambridge Zero, leads AI4ER. Page 4  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) •  Wischik is a mathematical statistician who, prior to joining us, was chief data scientist at Silicon Valley start-up Urban Engines (now part of Google).  The Department greatly benefits from the University’s support for interdisciplinary activities via its Strategic Research Initiatives and Networks (SRIs and SRNs) and Interdisciplinary Research Centres (IRCs). These groupings aim to address multidisciplinary research challenges, strengthen collaborations across disciplines, and influence research and policy agendas. Copestake co-directs the Cambridge Language Sciences IRC. The Cambridge Global Challenges SRI, co-led by Alan Blackwell, promotes research to advance sustainable development goals and works in collaboration with partners in low-income countries. Other SRNs and IRCs with substantial involvement from the Department include CamBridgeSens (sensors) and the Cambridge Centre for Data-Driven Discovery. Simon Moore and Jat Singh co-chair the Trust & Technology Initiative which was kickstarted with University funding. 1.3.4 Future strategic aims People. Our academic staff numbers have grown rapidly over the last seven years ( §2.1) but will not continue expanding at the same rate. As part of the SRR, it was decided we should keep to about 50 academic staff for the next few years. (This still implies recruiting 1-2 academic staff per year as staff retire or leave.) Supported by the University’s Equality and Diversity section, we plan to continue increasing our proportion of female and BAME staff. We will also offer several five-year fellowships for postdoctoral researchers with about three years’ experience post-PhD. (This gap in current provision results in us losing some of our most promising researchers to industry.) We have already hired four Fellows through the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. We also aim to further increase the PhD student numbers. These objectives require funding: further philanthropic donations (from industry or 
foundations) are the most likely source. Building. Plans drawn up in 2016-17 to extend our current building showed a high cost for a relatively small space gain and so were ruled unfeasible. However, some pressures on space are being relieved by the expansion of the University’s West Cambridge site, especially the Shared Facilities Hub (SFH), expected to be completed in 2021-22. The pandemic has probably put a substantial extension/new building beyond financial reach in the near future but has encouraged us to re-examine our use of space. So we are reconfiguring existing spaces to meet needs, e.g., repurposing our library space (since there will be a library in the SFH) as a flexible workshop/teaching area. Industrial and third-sector collaboration. Some of our most important current projects (e.g., CHERI*) involve multiple companies collaborating with our researchers and each other; we hope to increase this style of interaction. We also wish to support the involvement of third-sector organisations and other disciplines in our research. The Isaac* online platforms and the ALTA Institute are examples of this and form a core for further collaborative research in applications of computer technology in education. Research areas. We expect further growth in all areas, especially digital security, mobile devices, data science and ML. Increasing the impact of our activities within the University is a strategic aim, particularly through supporting the growth of ML/AI across Cambridge in collaboration with Information Engineering. We see huge potential for further growth in collaborative research in both sciences and humanities – a specific objective is to collaborate with the University’s new Centre for Digital Humanities. This also links with our aim to increase our work in education. Research support. We will further grow our new Research Strategy Team and recruit more project managers and research software engineers.  Page 5  Unit-level environment template (REF5b)  1.4 Impact Strategy The 2018 Strategic Research Review noted that “members of the Department have established strong, long-lived links to industry to support and develop ongoing world-leading research and explore new and exciting areas”, and “the majority of research done in the Department reaches wider society through government policy, the health sector, industry and charities.” This variety and vitality of impact is facilitated by the University’s intellectual property policy – which gives researchers the right to make results public and the ownership of copyright (including copyright in software) – and by University employment contracts that place few restrictions on employees’ activities outside the University. This offers researchers significant flexibility to engage in, among others, formal and informal collaborations with companies and third-sector organisations, spin-outs, start-ups, and non-profits. Our impact case studies reflect this range of paths to impact. Text prediction and feedback* led to a start-up and spin-out, both subsequently acquired by established companies; CHERI* and REMS* involve close collaboration and interchange of researchers with major industrial companies; nonprofit company Raspberry Pi* has achieved impact through community-building; the Isaac* online learning platforms do so by public service to education. Our strategy for sustaining impact is to maintain and develop an impact culture. Our impacts are diverse and individual researchers/groups of researchers are usually best placed to decide how to pursue them – though our Research Strategy Team also supports them, e.g., by suggesting sources of impact/translational funding or through their links with Cambridge Enterprise, the University’s commercialisation arm. Impact often requires continued hands-on involvement of academics in translation of research: the University’s liberal IP policy facilitates this, as does the Department’s willingness to support unpaid leave and other forms of flexible working. Potential for impact is an important factor in hiring and promotion: when hiring researchers, we pay as much (if not more) attention to the impact/potential for impact of their work as we do to the volume of their publications. Interchange of staff and students between academia and industry is also essential and several recently-recruited academic staff have joined us from industry (Huszar, Twitter; Lawrence, Amazon; Cengiz Oztireli, Disney Research Switzerland; Wischik, Urban Engines). Researchers are generous in sharing their experience with colleagues, and entrepreneurship (among staff and alumni) is celebrated in the Cambridge Ring. ( §4.4). Since 2019, we have been seeking to amplify our impact successes to raise the Department’s profile with prospective funders and collaborators. Ensuring impact is communicated much more widely is part of the new communications role. The Department’s culture is an integral part of the local Cambridge tech environment. Staff and alumni of the Department have so far created 300 companies and the central role the Department played in the Cambridge Phenomenon is well known. This high degree of interrelationship persists and grows. Members of local companies and third-sector organisations interact frequently with members of the Department, collaborating on research and start-ups, co-supervising PhD students, proposing undergraduate/postgraduate projects, giving seminars, acting as members of our Faculty Board and informally advising and being advised. Because of its ubiquity, this is impossible to quantify: as the SRR highlighted, members of the Department experience it as a unique culture and it is a major factor in their choice to come to, and stay in, Cambridge.  1.5 Open Research and Research Integrity We take full advantage of the University’s Open Access support (such as the Apollo repository, guidance on practice and training programmes for open research and open data management and Page 6  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) the Cambridge Open Access policy framework). However, we go well beyond these institutional measures: the right to release material as open source is strongly promoted by the Department through its long standing open culture, embodied in flexibility of collaboration, open source software and hardware outputs in many areas, open innovation practice evident in our impact strategy, and open research in sharing data and publications. Our open source release of the Xen hypervisor is a notable part of our history; it changed the discipline and flies the flag for the effectiveness of open research. Some more recent open source releases are described in §4.5. The Isaac* platforms are an example where an industry contract demands open source outputs and where the Departmental approach has enabled collaboration and impact. The Cambridge Cybercrime Centre pioneers practice around research data sharing for sensitive and illicit information. Department personnel have been involved with the CRASSH Open IP for Emerging Technologies research network, exploring the frontiers of open IP tech transfer. The Department supports a culture of research integrity via an ethical review model, informed by current best practice and the institutional Good Research Practice guidelines, and in consultation with other Schools within the University, and fellow universities. All research projects (including final year undergraduate and Masters’ projects) go through up to three stages of review: • • •  Self-assessment, which may lead to Departmental review, which may require guidance from a Specialist panel.  Our interdisciplinary interactions with humanities, law and social sciences broadens awareness of ethical issues around the Department. We support ethical review of projects from other disciplines when there is a computational angle. The Research Strategy Team plays a role in spotting potential issues at the early proposal stage. Review at proposal stage is encouraged to drive higher quality submissions. The Department works closely with the University’s Development, Research Operations and Research Strategy offices to ensure projects are appropriate. Discussion of methodological and ethical issues is also built into our teaching. Ensuring reproducibility is especially important in research that uses machine learning, and open sharing of datasets and software allows research results to be reproduced by others. More generally, our open research culture plays an important role in research integrity by ensuring that work can be informally, but critically reviewed by others before submission for publication.  Page 7  Unit-level environment template (REF5b)  2. People 2.1 Staffing strategy Our strategy for recruiting permanent academic staff reflects our research strategy of sustaining active research across the breadth of computer science while also encouraging work in important new areas. We made 23 appointments between January 2014 and July 2020 (a marked increase on the five appointments in the previous REF period). The appointments were at all levels of seniority – two Professors, one Reader, 11 Senior Lecturers and nine Lecturers – and seven of the 23 new appointees were women. In recruiting, we looked (as we continue to do) for excellent researchers with both relatively broad interests/expertise and the flexibility to adapt, a factor we regard as important given the rapidity with which research in our field moves and the fact that many staff stay with us long-term. Four new appointees came from industry (see §1.4) and one from a research institute. The remainder came from universities in the US (two), Canada (one), Switzerland (one), other UK institutions (nine) and Cambridge (five). The Department's strong reputation and strategy of empowering academic staff to work on research topics as they see best allows us to recruit and retain exceptionally talented people even in areas of keen academic and commercial competition: our new staff came to us with PhDs from world-leading institutions. We have a strong record in staff retention: academic staff may choose their own research agendas, and we are also flexible around consultancy work, work outside academics’ University commitments and IP ownership, recognising this generates welcome additional income for research staff and aids staff retention. Contract research staff have increased from 81 to 110. We had five Research Fellows without an underlying permanent position at the census date. Seeking more Fellowships to help the best researchers build up their research profile before undertaking the full demands of a permanent position, we recently introduced Departmental Early-Career Fellowships (DECAFs). We obtained philanthropic funding for the first four as part of the Accelerate Programme.  2.2 Staff development For all staff, we recognise the importance of training, mentoring, appraisals and promotions; opportunities to work flexibly; support for their wellbeing; and the need to continue improving equality and diversity in the Department. As the University is a signatory to the Researcher Development Concordat, all staff can access its comprehensive programme of training and professional development. Departmentally, new academic staff are assigned at least one and sometimes two mentors to help them settle in the short term and offer broader career mentoring longer term. The HoD and Departmental Secretary arrange mentors from outside new recruits’ research areas, whereas colleagues closer to their specialism monitor and advise them on their programme of research, both through routine informal contact and through the more formal biennial appraisals, which focus positively on support and academic career development. The mentors, alongside the HoD, provide support during the probation period. Other support for new academic staff includes the underwriting of PhD students and start-up funds (unrestricted, but normally used for travel, specialist equipment, etc) from Departmental reserves. New lecturers are given a reduced teaching load, usually joint-teaching one lecture course in their first year.  Page 8  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) The HoD annually and proactively identifies academic staff who are ready for promotion (often aided by appraisals and ensuring staff from underrepresented groups are considered). She encourages them to apply and supports them through the process, e.g., advising on the choice of referees. She or another member of staff with experience of the promotions process will review applicants’ promotion paperwork before it is submitted. She discusses steps to improve CVs with those who are not yet ready for promotion and gives detailed feedback in the (rare) cases where an application is unsuccessful. Evidence of the career development support we offer academic staff is shown in their strong performance in the University’s rigorous and competitive annual Senior Academic Promotion process (as part of which, applications are considered by up to three committees: our Faculty Promotions Committee, the School of Technology Promotions Committee and the University’s General Board). During this REF period, out of 39 applications, 35 resulted in promotion /approval for promotion – 6 to Senior Lecturer, 15 to Reader (3 of them women) and 14 to Professor (4 of them women) – a success rate of 90%. Support for postdoctoral researchers There were 110 contract research staff employed at the census date. In addition to the 22 Research Assistants (most of them also registered for the PhD), there were 88 postdoctoral staff – 67 Research Associates, 17 Senior Research Associates, 2 Principal Research Associates and 2 Research Fellows as well as 3 Research Fellows funded by colleges. Institutionally, the University retained its HR Excellence in Research award in 2015 – a recognition of its commitment to improving the working conditions and career development of research staff. It offers additional institutional support for research staff through the Postdoc Academy, the lead organisation for the postdoctoral community, which offers personal and professional development, pastoral and information support. There are also dedicated support programmes for postdoctoral staff at the Careers Service and the Researcher Development Programme, and subsidised staff housing in Eddington (near to the Department) for which many postdocs are eligible. Departmentally, postdocs make a vital contribution to our research and we work hard to support their continuing development. Postdocs employed on grants are recruited by academic staff with the support of the HR team. Each is ‘housed’ in a research group (and some in more than one) providing both their academic and social activities. The Department also has a Research Staff Forum – which meets termly, as a platform to assist postdocs - where staff issues such as training, availability of teaching opportunities and improving career progression can be brought for discussion. All main research groups are represented; the Department Secretary, Deputy Director for Postgraduate Education (Researcher Development) and Research Strategy Manager also attend and liaise with the HoD over issues / suggestions that arise. Contract research staff can apply for promotion from Research Associate (RA) to Senior Research Associate (SRA), which recognises their status as an independent researcher. There were 22 such promotions in this REF period. The appraisal process is important in identifying RAs who could be promoted to SRA and in advising both roles on their career options, academic and otherwise. Promotions are assessed by the Faculty Board. The Department makes information about the promotion procedure available via our intranet, including case studies from previous successful applicants on how they put their case for promotion. SRAs and Research Fellows with independent status are invited to the Department’s weekly staff meetings and offsite meetings, along with permanent academic staff, allowing them to play a role in decision-making around research issues. Some postdoctoral staff are involved in University teaching, including lecturing and supervision of Masters’ projects. We aim to make this opportunity more evenly available so all postdoctoral staff wishing to develop their teaching skills 
– e.g., to help them pursue a career in academia – are supported in doing so. Page 9  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Fellowships obtained by members of the Department are detailed in §3.1. Many postdoctoral staff and fellows leaving the Department have gone to permanent academic positions across the world, including at the Universities of Amsterdam, Bristol, Edinburgh, Otago and Oxford, Carnegie Mellon University, IIT Madras, Imperial College London and King’s College London. Four obtained permanent positions in the Department during the REF period. Others have gone into industry, including positions at Apple Research, Brit Insurance, Microsoft Research, Ocado, and to start-ups including Anvil and Navenio. Knowledge exchange and impact Academic staff are free to undertake consultancy: we recognise that it enhances their experience of industrial realities and problems, while also creating the links between academia and industry that are essential to knowledge exchange and impact. Some work is done pro bono; paid consultancy may be done through Cambridge University Technical Services (CUTS), or privately, as staff choose. Recently staff have consulted for, among others, Alcatel (Bell Labs), Apple, AOL, BBC, BT, CSR, France Telecom, Google, Intel, Juniper Networks, Microsoft, Netronome, and Orange. Academic staff are able – and indeed, expected – to take sabbatical leave one term in every seven. They may also take unpaid leave to work with companies. (Though this requires consideration of how to cover their teaching and supervision, it is important both for staff retention and, again, for impact.) Staff may also work for companies alongside their Department positions, as long as it enhances their academic work, for instance by allowing publishable research which would not be possible in an academic setting or by demonstrating impact. Mechanisms for recognising the impact of work by staff include the Department’s annual Hall of Fame awards They celebrate the success of companies founded by Department staff and graduates and successful products these companies create; the philanthropic or social impact of work by staff/graduates; and the most significant peer-reviewed paper by staff/graduates.  2.3 Research students During the current REF period we admitted 223 PhD students, funded by a mix of Research Council (mainly EPSRC) grants, University resources (e.g., Cambridge Trust, Gates and college scholarships), industrial philanthropy and studentships, project grants, international scholarships and students’ self-funding. Thanks mainly to an increase in industrial philanthropy, and the Department’s increased involvement with CDTs, student numbers are rising – as shown below.  Page 10  Unit-level environment template (REF5b)  Figure 1: PhD admissions by academic year. Reflecting our increased emphasis on interdisciplinarity, and our increased capacity in AI/ML/robotics, the Department is involved with the following CDTs: • • •  Sensor Technologies for a Healthy and Sustainable Future (SensorCDT) Application of Artificial Intelligence to the study of Environmental Risks (AI4ER). AgriFood Robotics (AgriFoRwArdS)  Admission to our PhD programme is highly competitive, our application process and training programme both support rigour; as a result, standards are very high. Students won British Computer Science Distinguished Dissertation Awards in 2015 and 2017; two more were runners-up in 2020. Recruitment The PhD application process is designed to combine rigour with support for unconventional backgrounds and diverse candidates – in the last five years, we have admitted students from Psychology, Earth Sciences and Land Economy as well as Mathematics, Engineering and Computer Science. Typically, about 40% of research students have taken either our one-year MPhil in Advanced Computer Science or the optional fourth year of the undergraduate Computer Science Tripos. These degrees are formally PGT but are intended to prepare students to start research, offering sessions on key skills from research publication to specific research methods, as well as modules on cuttingedge topics in Computer Science and Technology. The vast majority of the other PhD students admitted have undertaken Masters’ level training elsewhere, but we also admit students directly from industry, and a Masters’ is not a requirement for those with industry experience. Most such students have completed an undergraduate degree in Computer Science or Engineering before entering industry, but we have also admitted PhD students with incomplete undergraduate degrees who were recognised in industry as leading researchers. The students admitted in the last five years – 1 female, Page 11  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) 2 male – took some study from our MPhil, or some Open University classes, in their first year to ensure they were up to the academic rigour of a PhD. Monitoring and support We implemented the 2018 Strategic Research Review recommendation to introduce more structure to postgraduate student induction. Spread over two weeks, this now includes mandatory completion of several core units on researcher development including soft skills (presentations, confidence building), and better integration into the research groups from the outset. There are also sessions on career development, the help available from the counselling services, and Departmental IT support. Each student works closely with a supervisor and contributes to the work of a research group, collaborating with others as appropriate. PhD students are assigned both a primary supervisor and a separate graduate advisor who, along with the postgraduate student administrator, is available to discuss problems. Institutionally, PhD students are supported by the wider University and their college (e.g., with financial aid, housing, counselling, etc). All research students have access to necessary online resources and extensive computing facilities, as well as social spaces (café and common room) and events. For female and non-binary students, the women@CL initiative offers a mentoring scheme and online forum for advice on topics ranging from the PhD journey and scholarship funding to ‘imposter’ syndrome. The PhD programme includes formal assessments at the end of each year. Students have a viva at the end of the first year, including a report on their progress and research proposal, to demonstrate they are likely to proceed successfully. The second-year report is expected to include detailed plans for completion of the PhD. A third-year progress statement – including either a draft of their dissertation or a plan for finishing it – is considered by the Director of Postgraduate Education. Skills development and career preparation Research groups offer students opportunities to develop their skills, e.g., by contributing to weekly seminars or practising their presentations of workshop/conference papers. PhD students are encouraged to submit papers to, and attend, international workshops to make contacts. The Department has funding to support this when other sources are unavailable. Researcher development is integrated into the first year of PhD study with a compulsory module on the underlying skills required for research, including designing experiments, analysing experimental results, and research ethics. In subsequent years, PhD students are offered a programme of further training, including a range of teaching and research-related courses from the University’s personal and professional development staff. Researcher development activity is evaluated and refined in consultation with students by way of the Postgraduate Students’ Forum (a Departmental committee formed of student representatives chaired by the Deputy Director of Postgraduate Education (Researcher Development)).  2.4 Equality and Diversity Recruiting the best people and ensuring the department is a friendly and supportive place to work for everyone is central to our strategy. Our HoD, as she wrote in our 2018 Athena SWAN submission, has herself experienced “the insidious effects of being a woman in a male-dominated subject” and leads the Department in its commitment to addressing equality and diversity. Institutionally, the University supports diversity through a range of initiatives and offers networks for staff and students such as the LGBTQ+ Staff network, the BAME Staff Network and SPACE (for those with caring responsibilities). In recruitment, diversity is explicitly monitored by the University’s HR team.  Page 12  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) The Department holds an Athena SWAN Bronze award (first received in 2015, renewed in 2018) and made great progress between those dates, including doubling the number of female academic staff. The Department’s Equality & Diversity Committee prepares the submission and implements the action plan. Its members represent all staff groups and roles, a range of circumstances (UK/international, different caring responsibilities, etc), and Departmental initiatives such as women@CL (see below). The Department has regularly surveyed staff and students to learn their views about the challenges they face. Actions include ensuring meetings are timed to be compatible with caring/childcare responsibilities and increasing mentoring for postdoctoral staff. All members of staff – and most PhD students – are required to take the University’s Equality & Diversity and Implicit Bias training. This is explicitly checked before they take part in any promotion, recruitment, or supervision activity. Women@CL exists to support women in computing science in their careers and help them aspire to leadership positions. It is directed by a committee of postdocs and students, with a member of academic staff as liaison; the Department provides administrative support and core funding. Women@CL runs networking events and raises the visibility of female role-models with talks where women academics discuss their research. It runs local career development workshops and (with Oxford University) the Oxbridge Women in Computer Science conference (open to everyone in STEM, regardless of gender identity). Hutchings founded a Departmental LGBTQ+@CL network in 2018, offering meetings and resources. One postdoc described it recently as “a really welcome link to the queer community at the Lab,” adding: “Cambridge lacks any dedicated LGBTQ bars or cafes, and much of the local community is concentrated around the colleges – so for postdocs who are not affiliated to colleges, this can lead to feeling cut off from potential community, support networks, etc. The LGBTQ+@CL initiative is really good, particularly as a resource for new starters to get to know people.” Institutionally, the University LGBT+ Staff Network provides information and support to staff, helps coordinate diversity events and helps the University to progress equality. Though we have further to go, the Department is steadily improving its gender balance. Chairs of selection panels have instituted proactive searches for female applicants. The proportion of female academic staff rose from 12% at the last REF to 20% now. There were only two female Professors at the time of the last REF (one of whom retired shortly afterwards); there are now five. At the current census date, 24% of the contract researchers were female and 40% of the Fellows. (This has since risen to 55% of Fellows, following the appointment of our Departmental Early Career Fellows.) The proportion of female PhD students during this period has fluctuated between 18% and 27%. As of the start of the year 2020-21, it is 27.2%. Following an initial gift in 2018-19 from DeepMind to fund three Masters’ students from underrepresented backgrounds (female, and/or BAME), a further gift is supporting three more MPhil and two PhD students who started in October 2020. Such philanthropic funding is very welcome: it aids our efforts to increase diversity in the Department, and we are actively investigating further opportunities with possible donors. Support for staff and students with disabilities is tailored to their particular needs, with advice from the University’s Occupational Health Service (for staff) and the Disability Resource Centre (mainly for students, although some resources are also helpful for staff). Leave, wellbeing and flexible working policies The Department allows academic staff to organise their own time, giving parents/carers freedom to organise their work around their caring responsibilities. We are also flexible in how formally-specified hours and days of work are handled. In practice, most computer scientists require little specialist equipment so remote working/working from home is commonplace. Where there is need, we will supply equipment for home working – including any equipment needed to support staff with disabilities, or problems such as RSI – some of which can be purchased with grant money. (During Page 13  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) the pandemic, we have supplied office chairs, standing desks and equipment for recording lectures to staff.) While most Departmental staff except those whose job requires them to be there at fixed hours (e.g., Reception staff) choose to work full-time, around 11% work part-time (16 female, 13 male). The University has considerably more generous maternity/paternity/adoption leave provision than required by law. Its graduated return to work policy allows staff to return to work for a minimum of 20% of full-time hours. To support that, we provide breastfeeding and milk refrigeration facilities. Additionally, we offer a range of flexible working options: part-time/term-time working, job share, compressed or annual hours, flexitime, or staggered hours. The Department also underwrites funding for contracts of research staff whose contracts would otherwise finish during their period of parental leave. The Department encourages researchers to use the Institutional Returning Carers’ Scheme, which funds and supports return to work and professional development following a career break or leave for caring responsibilities. Since 2013, four Department members have used this scheme (Laura Rimell, Mateja Jamnik, Noa Zilberman, Poonam Yadav). We are located near two University Workplace Nurseries (West Cambridge and Eddington) and benefit from institutional services such as a salary exchange scheme to support childcare costs. The University Counselling Service is available to staff and students: it is expected that counselling services will be available in the new West Cambridge Shared Facilities Hub which is very close to the Department. The Department provides a range of social/wellbeing opportunities to promote interactions between staff and students, e.g., weekly ‘Happy Hour’ gatherings run by postdocs and PhD students and open to all. We have two Wellbeing Advocates. In 2019, they established a committee to formalise their remit and more effectively promote wellbeing among staff and research students. The committee signposts University initiatives (e.g., its Festival of Wellbeing), promotes Departmental ones, and works with the Department’s HR Manager to improve staff processes. Equality and Diversity in the context of the REF submission The working methods document for the Unit of Assessment includes a section on how its committee handled Equality & Diversity (paragraph 13). This was checked by the University's REF secretariat and found to conform to the University's policies which themselves have been approved by the national REF authorities. All members of the committee handling the submission for the Unit of Assessment took the University's training course on Equality & Diversity Essentials and on Understanding Unconscious/Implicit Bias. A further course on Equality & Diversity for REF2021 was taken by the Chairman, the Lead for Equality & Diversity, and the Administrator. The Department's criteria for promotion to Senior Research Associate reflect the REF2021 indicators of research independence, so identifying staff with significant responsibility for research was straightforward. Discretion was only required for determining the independent status of Research Associates who would be eligible for promotion to Senior Research Associate were funding available. These were resolved 
in consultation with the Principal Investigators on whose projects they were employed. The affected staff were individually contacted to inform them of these decisions, and none of the decisions were challenged. All eligible staff were invited to nominate outputs for inclusion in the submission. These were independently assessed for their originality, rigour, and significance. Outputs were then selected for submission so as to best reflect research quality in the Department while complying with the REF requirements for the number of outputs from each member of staff and the overall number of outputs. Page 14  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Staff were notified of the selection, invited to comment and the selection refined in the light of their responses. Again, none of the decisions have been challenged.  Page 15  Unit-level environment template (REF5b)  3. Income, infrastructure and facilities 3.1 Research funding and strategies for generating income  Figure 2: Charts showing comparison of funding sources in 2013-14 and 2019-20, by percentage of total value of awards received. The Department made the strategic decision in 2010 to diversify its portfolio of research funders and generate research income by combining public funding with industrial sponsorship and philanthropic gifts. Figure 2 (above) shows a comparison of funding sources in 2013-14 and 2019-20, illustrating how continuing that strategy has worked well; increasing proportions of our research income now derive from the third sector, industry and philanthropy. Philanthropic funding from industry is particularly valuable because it can be used to balance other sources. It has enabled us to admit 20 more PhD students in the last two years and allows us to bridge short gaps between research grants for contract researchers. Where research contracts may be shorter-term and focus on delivery of specific outcomes, philanthropic gifts free us to pursue higher-level goals and help us maintain longer-term academic vision and drive. Our success in obtaining substantial and sustained philanthropic donations (e.g., from Nokia Bell Labs and Qualcomm) is thanks to a combination of highly proactive engagement by successive HoDs and other staff, the excellence of the University’s Development Office, and our reputation for advancing the field. We obtain public funding through responsive-mode applications to UKRI and the ERC via responses to specific calls and through personal fellowships. Alongside public funding, we have obtained funding from UK government departments (e.g., Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport), charities (e.g., The Leverhulme Trust) and industry (e.g., AstraZeneca, Cambridge Assessment, Facebook, Google, and GSK). This period has also seen a considerable increase in funding from overseas government sources. This Department is one of very few UK institutions to receive funding from DARPA, and this is due to the strong relationship between the Computer Architecture Group (Simon Moore, Robert Watson) and SRI International.  Page 16  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) We anticipate this heterogeneity of funding continuing as we proceed with projects across a large number of different disciplines. Beyond the constraint of ethical due diligence, academic staff are free to choose their research direction and the funding sources they approach. Our success in obtaining funding is additionally helped by our Departmental Research Strategy Team and Finance Office (as described in §3.3), and institutionally by the University’s Research Operations Office and Development Office, with whom we liaise closely. New funders in this period include Alcatel-Lucent Technologies, Autonomous Surface Vehicles, Cabinet Office, Cambridge Consultants, DeepMind Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Input Output HK, Nokia UK, Orange, Raspberry Pi Foundation and Thales UK. During the current REF period we have obtained substantial industrial funding for major initiatives: • • •  • • • •  The ALTA Institute received £2.8M from Cambridge Assessment to conduct research into improving the linguistic proficiency of learners and automated forms of assessment of language performance. (Ted Briscoe, Paula Buttery) The Centre for Mobile Wearable Systems and Augmented Intelligence is funded by a £1.75M donation from Nokia Bell Labs over five years to explore how to augment and improve the human experience in a digitally connected world. (Cecilia Mascolo, Alastair Beresford) The work on OCaml Labs was funded during the period by Jane Street (£4.5M), with other supplementary industry funding. It develops and promotes the OCaml functional programming language as an open-source platform that can be used widely by both industry and academia. (Anil Madhavapeddy, Jeremy Yallop). Huawei has given a donation to support PhD students over five years. The Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery includes funding from Schmidt Futures for four new Departmental Early-Career Academic Fellows. Additionally, the funding will support six PhD students and six postdoctoral research fellowships. Donations from ARM and DeepMind Technologies support work in computer architecture and trustworthy systems engineering. Additional funds have come from Microsoft for the Cloud Computing Research Centre in collaboration with Queen Mary University of London. (Jon Crowcroft).  The Department is also proud of the number of academic staff who obtain grants from the European Research Council (ERC) via its internationally competitive process. In this period, nine ERC grants were awarded to staff. They were made at all three levels and across a wide range of research projects, underlining the breadth and excellence of the research being conducted here by academic staff at all career stages: • • •  ERC Starting Grant (Thomas Sauerwald, 2015; Nic Lane, 2019; Alice Hutchings, 2020; Amanda Prorok, 2020) ERC Consolidator Grant (Rafal Mantiuk, 2017; Andreas Vlachos, 2019) ERC Advanced Grant (Larry Paulson, 2016; Peter Sewell, 2017; Cecilia Mascolo, 2019)  These grantees were in addition to four existing ERC grant recipients (Advanced Grant, Glynn Winskel, 2011; Starting Grants, Stephen Clark, Rob Mullins, Frank Stajano, 2012) whose work has enriched our research environment. Other significant grant awards made by external bodies on a competitive basis include the following EPSRC Fellowships: • • •  Early Career Digital Economy Fellowship (Jat Singh, 2017) Early Career Fellowship (Hatice Gunes, 2019) Senior Turing AI Fellowship (Lawrence, 2019)  Page 17  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Postdoctoral Fellowships We encourage postdoctoral researchers to apply for relevant fellowships. As a Department, we can offer some matched funding for these; the University supports postdocs applying for Leverhulme Fellowships – prestigious post-doctoral awards for researchers near the start of their career – through matched funding from the Isaac Newton Trust. The following fellowships were awarded: • • • • • •  The Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 (KC Sivaramakrishnan, 2015) Royal Society University Research Fellowship (Cristina David, 2017) Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship (Noa Zilberman, 2016) Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship (Ekaterina Shutova, 2015) Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship (Franck Courbon, 2017) Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship (Martin Kleppmann, 2019)  The first four listed subsequently went on to faculty positions (IIT Madras, January 2019; Bristol, January 2020; Oxford, January 2020; Amsterdam, February 2018), the last two remain in the Department. Additionally, college stipendiary Junior Research Fellowships, which are highly competitive (generally over 100 applicants per place), were awarded to Heidi Howard, Guy Emerson and Marwa Mahmoud.  3.2 Operational infrastructure As outlined in §1.3.2, we established a Research Strategy Team in this REF period to improve the way we support researchers at all levels through the research funding lifecycle – as shown here.  Figure 3: Support offered to researchers throughout the research funding lifecycle. Working with our finance office, the Team leads on research funding and partnerships and liaises with colleagues in the University, industry and the third sector to support research, networking and collaborations.  Page 18  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) The Research Strategy Manager promotes prospective funders and collaborators to researchers considering a funding application. She recruits relevant panellists (often including researchers who have previously secured the same grant / fellowship) to run mock interviews. After the funding award, she and the Team assist with knowledge transfer and impact arising from the research, offering researchers support in accessing funding for impact. This has helped the Department achieve a high success rate for its applications to the University EPSRC Impact Accelerate Account. She also works with the Department’s Communications Coordinator to raise the profile of the research and its impact to draw the attention of other prospective funders, partners, and beneficiaries. She stays abreast of funding opportunities and policies by attending relevant research council meetings and through links with the University Research Strategy Office. She and the Research Strategy Team work closely with networks / affiliations across the University – in areas including knowledge exchange, funding operations and entrepreneurial support – and beyond, e.g., with sector specific networks such as Agri-techE. The Department has received funding for several Knowledge Transfer Fellowships to support postdoctoral researchers to spend a year working with an industrial partner to apply the results of an EPSRC-funded research project to that business. Examples include TranscenData (2014), ARM (three fellowships in total during 2016-17), Smart Cambridge (2017) and the Met Office (2018). The Department’s Entrepreneur in Residence is also part of the Research Strategy Team and can offer help and advice to researchers when they are looking to commercialise their ideas.  3.3 Use of infrastructure for impact activities The Department is housed in the William Gates Building – a purpose-built facility providing quiet office space, small group offices for PhD students, workshop and lab facilities, lecture theatres and a networking area. It houses both researchers and visitors and enables us to host symposiums and outreach events, enhancing our external connections and furthering research interaction. Specialist computing support within the Department is provided by an IT team, in addition to the general support offered by the University Information Services. The team provides support for most aspects of our research provision ranging from purchase through to installation and maintenance of servers, storage, and networking. The Department’s data centre offers a number of specialist facilities for researchers, including a GPU cluster for development of machine learning systems, support for prototyping of novel hardware interconnected by high-speed optical networking, a flexible private cloud providing virtual servers, and a highly-reconfigurable and monitorable ‘model data centre’ for experimentation on distributed systems and novel network architectures. Individual groups have additional specialised research equipment pertinent to them, usually purchased through research grants. The University Information Services' High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters are also available to Department members, used in conjunction with Departmental GPU and CPU clusters. The HPC is funded partly (27%) by the Department with the rest (73%) coming from University funds. The considerable in-house computing and communication systems are enhanced by the extensive network infrastructure provided by the University Information Services; for example, the Department’s research has made extensive use of the University’s dark fibre network around the city centre.  3.4 Benefits in kind Beyond our own research software and equipment, our sponsors and collaborators enable us to access unique datasets and industrial equipment and assets that greatly assist our research. These Page 19  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) have included a network simulator from Microsoft, FPGA boards from Xilinx, GPUs from NVIDIA (to enable our network traffic research), specialist software from Broadcom and Xilinx, cloud computing credits from Microsoft and Google or anonymized service usage datasets (such as one from location service company Foursquare Inc, which enabled substantial and unique human urban mobility analysis studies).  Page 20  Unit-level environment template (REF5b)  4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society 4.1 Support for research collaborations Collaborating with others, and in doing so accelerating the impact of research for all partners involved, has been central to the Department’s ethos since Maurice Wilkes and his team built EDSAC in 1949 with the aim of creating a general use computer that could benefit as many researchers as possible. Today the Department collaborates widely: with academia (locally, nationally and internationally), industry, government and third sector organisations. This is facilitated, as outlined in §1.4, by the freedom academic staff have over the amount and type of collaborations they undertake. Additionally, their connections across the Cambridge research landscape, through the collegiate system and interdisciplinary networks, also aid collaboration. When staff seek to collaborate with external partners, we are deliberately flexible over the models of collaboration. As described in §3.3, our Research Strategy Manager and her Team play a key role in enabling/supporting collaborations. The Research Strategy Manager proactively seeks out collaborators, is first point of contact for potential industrial / third sector partners who approach the Department; and works to find the best alignment between academic research interests and issues prospective collaborators are looking to solve. Collaborations keep our research projects grounded and relevant. To facilitate them, we are flexible over allowing visitors from industry / academia to work in the Department for both short and long stays. In this REF period, more than 70 staff between them hosted over 700 visitors including scholars, investors, and industrial partners. The OCaml Labs project calculates that in 10 years it has welcomed over 100 visitors (including industry staff, developers, programmers and academics) to help its work on bringing an elegant and precise functional programming language out of obscurity and encourage its use in industry. This openness to visitors helped turn Cambridge into a hub for the OCaml developer community, which continues to work on the open-source language and further its development. Researchers from Nokia Bell Labs (which funds The Centre for Mobile Wearable Systems and Augmented Intelligence) have ‘Visiting Scholar’ status in the Department, giving the company flexible access to our teams, enabling them to discuss ideas with PIs here, and directly recruit interns and researchers from the Department – a valuable benefit to them. We use various models of collaboration to sustain longer-term research. For example, with one major industry partner we set up a framework agreement, running for five years from November 2019, through which they committed to fund research in this Department (plus a division of another University Department). Because the contract negotiation was carried out as part of the overall framework agreement, rather than on a project-by-project basis, academic staff can apply to the resulting pot of research funding through a lightweight application process that is much more streamlined than for individual industry grants. Institutionally, the University’s liberal approach to IP ( §1.4) makes Cambridge a very attractive environment for both researchers and collaborators. Additionally, we benefit from infrastructure provided by the University. About two-thirds of academic staff (and all students) belong to a Cambridge college: these provide extra facilities, including additional funding to support travel and other research 
costs, and accommodation for visiting academics. This helps us host workshops, visitors, and meetings with collaborators. Page 21  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) The Department also benefits significantly from the University’s world-class facilities, such as its copyright library. Several researchers collaborate with the Department of Engineering in photonics and display technology, with Engineering’s fabrication facilities vital to that research.  4.2 Academic collaborations The Department engages in numerous academic collaborations locally, nationally and internationally, often involving partners in a range of disciplines. Nationally, this Department was a founding member of The Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. Several academic staff spend time there (e.g., Crowcroft as Chair of the Institute’s Programme Committee) and advise Turing PhD students and run Turing projects: Buttery has a project around understanding social media and unrest; Crowcroft has a project in collaboration with Imperial on providing confidential cloud machine learning platforms, and another with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on Trustworthy Digital Identity. Anuj Dawar is contributing to foundational work in logic for data science. Wischik works in electrical vehicle charging networks. We continue to forge new national collaborations. In 2020 we teamed for the first time with the University of Lincoln on a Research England Ceres Agri-Tech project where Oztireli works with academic staff on using data science/AI to boost cereal yields. Internationally, the Department has had eight years’ joint funding from DARPA, with SRI as the prime contractor, to research fundamentally more secure computer systems. This work has been led here by Watson and Simon Moore, with a team of over 20 researchers with a broad range of computer science skills, enabling work on new processor architecture, hardware prototypes, compiler support, operating system porting, and benchmarking of applications. This level of funding has gone beyond anything available through standard EPSRC funding mechanisms and has been critical to enable hiring a team with the required breadth of skills to undertake the research and compete with top universities in the USA. The unusual skills of this team have driven effective industry engagement and unlocked significant government industrial funding, as evidenced in the CHERI* case study. Local collaborations include establishing with the Department of Engineering – supported by substantial University funding – ‘The Observatory for Human-Machine Collaboration’ in 2018 for the holistic study of the fundamentals of human-machine interaction by putting human and technological perspectives on an equal footing. Lio’s work on machine learning approaches for the analysis of bio-medical data sets has led to collaborations with the University Departments of Clinical Neurosciences, Haematology, Oncology, Psychiatry, Radiology, and Veterinary Medicine. Holden has been collaborating with researchers in the Department of Biochemistry since 2012, applying Bayesian inference, probabilistic programming and computational learning theory to drug design and proteomics. Mascolo, who works with different domains on the application of mobile sensor technology, is currently collaborating with the Department of Clinical Neuroscience on diagnostic methodologies for Alzheimer’s disease, and with Psychology on behavioural interventions delivered via mobile devices.  4.3 Developing relationships with key research users We purposefully seek a diversity of partnerships and funding sources for research projects as this helps them develop and evolve through several funding cycles. We also involve collaborators from Page 22  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) heterogeneous disciplines as bringing a range of perspectives to bear on the research helps keep it relevant. Projects that have built long-lasting platforms are detailed in the REMS*, Text prediction and feedback* and CHERI* case studies. Such long-term programmes mean we can see research through its lifecycle from initial idea, through trial and error, to success, knowledge transfer and impact via a spin-out (as from the Unikernels* research), or adoption by a national priority research programme (as with CHERI* and the UK Digital Security by Design Challenge), or via a government department, as with the Isaac* Learning project and the Department for Education. Since the last REF, we have demonstrated our ability to build on existing research relationships to develop long-term collaborative partnerships with industry. In several cases, by identifying ideas arising from initial collaborations, discussing them with partners and agreeing milestones and deliverables, we have negotiated larger research contracts with them. Examples include ARM (Timothy Jones, Simon Moore, Peter Sewell), Boeing (Beresford), Microsoft Research (Alan Blackwell), Google (Hopper) and Samsung (Mullins). We also have industrial collaborations with many of the technology spin-outs from this Department or cognate University departments. We have ongoing and productive engagements with (among others) the Raspberry Pi Foundation (Mullins, Alan Mycroft), Cambridge Assessment (Briscoe), SolarFlare (Hopper, Andrew Moore, Rice), and Ubisense (Hopper). Formal collaborations with smaller companies often consist of a joint application for funding to organisations such as Innovate UK. In the last three years, Briscoe has had two consecutive Innovate UK projects with All Street, who have just launched their first product, and the outputs of Gunes’ recent project with ‘Sensing Feeling’ are currently being commercialised.  4.4 External engagement mechanisms We sustain engagement with our alumni and their businesses (key users of our research) through our graduate association, the Cambridge Ring. Members can network with us and each other – e.g., to make new contacts in key sectors, share job opportunities and interact with our students by offering student projects. Members are also invited (as are the public) to our keynote research outreach event, the annual Wheeler Lecture. Held virtually for the first time in May 2020 due to the pandemic, it attracted 350 attendees. In 2019, the Research Strategy Team assumed management of the Cambridge Ring and put more membership management structure in place, increased communications with alumni and surveyed them to learn more about how the Ring can benefit them. Membership has since doubled and we anticipate increased engagement with our alumni. The Research Strategy Team also manages our Supporters Club – another mechanism for engaging with wider audiences. This mixed group of local, national and international businesses, ranging from very small to major multinationals, helps support Departmental research through their financial donations to the Department, and via networking and industrial opportunities. Supporters’ Club income is used for purposes including funding early stage research, as bridge funding for postdoctoral researchers, and for outreach activities such as our annual Open Days. Members welcome interaction with the Department, including at the annual dinner where they can network with academic staff and research students. We also engage with wider communities and publics through publications. Notable books in this period include Martin Kleppmann’s Designing Data-Intensive Applications, translated into six languages and selling over 100,000 copies. Java 8 In Action and Modern Java in Action, co-authored by Mycroft (with alumnus Raoul-Gabriel Urma and collaborator Mario Fusco), have sold over 30,000 copies.  Page 23  Unit-level environment template (REF5b)  4.5 Wider contributions to Economy, Society and Response to National and International Priorities We have a long history of working collaboratively with large open source and open (or licensed) data projects and demonstrating the value of doing so by advancing knowledge, generating academic papers and creating jobs. Examples include an open source silicon venture that was incubated in the Department before spinning out as a non-profit company. In November 2019 it announced OpenTitan, the first open source silicon root of trust, a collaborative engineering project with Google, ETH Zürich, Western Digital and other major corporate partners. Other examples include the Isabelle theorem prover; CamFort; Automerge; the COVID-19 Sounds App; the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre and DELPH-IN (one of the first organisations making open source computational linguistics code and data available). This interest in open code and data has extended to an interest in open models of academic publishing: Lawrence is Founder and Series Editor of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, a highly active journal that now publishes the proceedings of three major ML conferences (UAI, ICML and AISTATS) while being completely free for submitters and with the authors retaining copyright. The Department is eager to see computer science more deeply integrated into society, and to promote computing for social good. Examples of work here range from Vlachos’s project on Automated Verification of Textual Claims to combat the proliferation of misinformation online, to the FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification) dataset in collaboration with Amazon, and to Giving Voice to Digital Democracies (Copestake in collaboration with CRASSH, the University’s Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities and the Department of Engineering). This looks at ethical issues in speech and language technology such as virtual assistants and machine translation. The Department is closely involved with Cambridge Global Challenges (CGC); this University Strategic Research Initiative works with partners in developing countries to deliver projects to address challenges there. We have hosted CGC members for some years, Blackwell is its CoDirector, and from October 2020 CGC is formally ‘housed’ in the Department. Department members working on CGC projects include Eiko Yoneki on the BugAlert initiative to shift traditional, labourintensive crop pest detection methods to smart crop monitoring technology. Through CGC, there has also been collaboration with Africa’s Voices Foundation, an interdisciplinary humanitarian charity. Department member Dr Luke Church is Senior Advisor there, working alongside social scientists on projects including (in 2020) supporting the Covid-19 public health response in Kenya. Many Department researchers (including Ross Anderson, Hutchings, Lawrence and Singh) are part of the University’s Centre for Science and Policy, which brings together public policy professionals and academics to learn from each other and improve the use of evidence and expertise in public policy. During this REF period, 37 members of the Department engaged with Policy Fellows at over 100 meetings. These included workshops on transport and data policy organised by Mascolo, and Crowcroft’s involvement in the Cambridge University Press Data and Policy journal and a Data for Policy conference. Similarly, the Trust & Technology Initiative – a University-wide programme led by the Department – is a forum for interdisciplinary research exploring the dynamics of trust and distrust in relation to internet technologies, society and power. Along with Raspberry Pi, we pursue multidisciplinary public engagement. In addition to our successful collaboration with them on the Isaac* Computer Science platform, there is the development of Sonic Pi, the code-based music creation and performance tool. This non-profit spinout from the Department has substantial international impact, attracting a community of 1.5M coders and being used in music education initiatives in the UK, Africa and Finland. Many academic staff work in advancing healthcare, e.g., Lio, Jamnik and Mascolo with clinical collaborators to advance the use of systems and machine learning to improve diagnosis and patient care in areas from breast cancer to Alzheimer’s disease. Meanwhile, many repurposed their research in 2020 to address the pandemic, including Crowcroft and Yoneki’s seminal work on digital Page 24  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) contact tracing, Lio’s work on machine learning for intensive care patient stay prediction, Mascolo’s work on audio-based diagnostics for COVID-19 sounds.  Also responding to the pandemic were academic staff at the interdisciplinary Cambridge Cybercrime Centre. Established in 2015 by Richard Clayton with EPSRC funding, it combines expertise from this Department and the University’s Institute of Criminology and Faculty of Law and has one of academia's largest data sets on cybercrime, used by over 100 researchers at over 30 universities. The Centre gathered a mass of data on the surge in pandemic- and lockdown-related cybercrime and from July onwards produced weekly briefing papers for policymakers, practitioners and academics. Establishing the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery in 2020 to speed the use of machine learning by researchers in other disciplines was a key milestone for the Department and underlines our commitment to leverage further impact from research by delivering relevant skills training for researchers. In July 2020, we delivered the inaugural ‘Data for Science’ programme to PhD students and postdocs in disciplines outside Computer Science (including chemistry, engineering, medicine and psychology), helping them learn to apply data analysis to their own datasets.  4.6 Indicators of wider Influence, contributions and recognition Several staff from the Department serve/have served as government advisors, including: • • • • •  Hopper in the government’s Innovation Expert Group Jamnik as Specialist Adviser to the House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence Lawrence as member of the government’s AI Council, and on the Committee of the Royal Society DELVE (Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics) initiative Richard Mortier as Advisor to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport on Internet of Things, and Internet Protocols Anderson as a member of the UK Cybersecurity Policy Working Group and working with the EU Data Protection Board (EU Commission Data Regulator)  Staff elected as Fellows of the Royal Society: • •  Crowcroft, 2013 Paulson, 2017  Royal Society Medals: •  Bakerian Medal (Hopper, 2017)  Awards: • • • • • • •  British Computer Society Lovelace Medal (Anderson, 2015) N2 Women Stars in Computer Networking and Communications Award (Mascolo, 2016) Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automated Reasoning (Paulson, 2017) Google Security and Privacy Research award (Beresford, 2018) N2 Women Rising Stars in Computer Networking and Communications (Zilberman, 2018) Alonzo Church Award (Andrew Pitts, 2019) SIGMOBILE Rockstar Early Career Award (Lane, 2020)  Distinguished/Best Paper Awards include: • •  Crowcroft, A Moore, Watson at NSDI 2015 A Moore at SIGCOMM 2017 Page 25  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) • • • • • • • • •  Prorok at DARS 2018 Robert Harle at UbiComp 2018 Mascolo at Ubicomp 2014 and Ubicomp 2019 Rice at OOPSLA 2017 and ICSE 2019 Neel Krishnaswami, Yallop at PLDI 2019 S Moore, Sewell, Robert Watson at ASPLOS 2019 Hutchings at the Symposium of ECrime 2019 Krishnaswami at POPL 2020 Madhavapeddy at ICFP 2020.  ‘Test of Time’ Awards: • • • • • • • • •  A Moore at SIGMETRICS 2015 Hopper at SIGMOBILE 2016 Mullins, S Moore at ASP-DAC 2016 Sewell at SIGPLAN 2017 Lane at SenSys 2018 Harle at UbiComp 2018 Marcelo Fiore and Pitts (separately) at LICS Symposium 2019 The NetFPGA project (led by A Moore) received the ACM SIGCOMM SOSR System Award in 2019 Marcus Kuhn at IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2020  PhD Student Awards: The quality of research conducted by our PhD students has been recognised by these awards: • • • • • • • • • •  Bhatty, CPHC/BCS Distinguished Dissertation Award 2015 Bulat, Women Techmakers (formerly Google Anita Borg) Scholarship 2015 Dolan, CPHC/BCS Distinguished Dissertation Award 2017 Kumar, ACM SIGPLAN Doctoral Dissertation Award 2017 Brouwer, Homerton Santander Award for PhD Research 2017 D’Silva, N2Women Networking and Communications Rising Star

Many are also visiting faculty at other institutions including in this period Lio at Padova, Jamnik at the Centre for the Future of Intelligence, Pitts to Aarhus University, Mycroft to IIT Bombay, Buttery as Principal Investigator, Computational Linguistic skills training at Makerere University, in collaboration with Andrew Caines and Marek Rei. Many Department members are fellows of learned societies and professional bodies, including in leadership roles, e.g., Hopper as Treasurer and Vice-President of the Royal Society. Fellowships include Paulson and Pitts at the ACM; S Moore at the BCS and IET; John Daugman at the US National Academy of Inventors. Crowcroft, Mascolo and Pitts have served as Advisory Board Page 26  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) members for the Max Planck Software Systems Institute. Department members also contribute to the wider academic community through refereeing publications and acting as members of grantawarding panels (e.g., Copestake, Crowcroft, Mascolo, Pitts, Robinson have served on ERC Research Grant panels). Copestake, Crowcroft, Hopper and Paulson have been on Royal Society University Fellowships and Award Committees. (Paulson is currently serving on the Milner Award Committee.) A number of Department academics are editors of journals, including Lawrence (Action Editor for the Journal of Machine Learning Research; Series Editor of the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research), Pitts (Area Editor for logic and computation for the Journal of the ACM, founding Editor of Forum of Mathematics, Pi and Sigma (CUP) until 2017), and Gem Stapleton, Co-Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Visual Languages and Sentient Systems, and Editorial Board member for the Journal of Visual Languages and Computing.

"Unit-level environment template (REF5b) Institution: Birkbeck, University of London Unit of Assessment: 11 – Computer Science and Informatics 1. Unit context and structure, research and impact strategy 1.1 Unit context and structure Founded in 1957, the Department of Computer Science and Information Systems is one of the oldest computing departments world-wide and one of four departments in the School of Business, Economics and Informatics (BEI). Historically a small department (18.8 FTE returned to REF2014), we have grown by 30% since REF2014. Having a long-established reputation in data management and computational intelligence, we have evolved into a worldleading centre in Algorithms, Data Science, Knowledge Representation, and Verification, as evidenced by (i) our Q1 position for research outputs in REF2014; (ii) subsequent 70% growth in the number of publications, in such highly prestigious venues as JACM, AIJ, JAIR, JMLR, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TSE, TPAMI, FOCS, PODS, LICS, IJCAI; (iii) 50% growth in research grant awards; (iv) rapidly expanding network of international, interdisciplinary, industrial and publicsector collaborators. Our REF2014 results highlighted our strengths in algorithms and theory, leading to an ambitious development programme which expanded and refocused our research into three Groups: Knowledge Representation & Data Management, Experimental Data Science and Algorithms, Verification & Software; and two research Centres: Birkbeck Institute for Data Analytics (BIDA) and Birkbeck Knowledge Lab (BKL). The Groups focus on specific areas of computer science, with fluid boundaries facilitating inter-group collaborations and departmental cohesion. The Centres are interdisciplinary, spearheading new collaborations within and beyond the College. BIDA was established in 2015 to focus the development of college-wide research in data science, combining our expertise with domain-specific knowledge from all disciplinary areas at Birkbeck: Sciences, Social Sciences, Law, Arts & Humanities. BKL was launched in 2016, extending the legacy of the London Knowledge Lab (2001–2015), a joint initiative with the UCL Institute of Education. BKL’s research draws upon multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives to investigate how digital technologies are transforming our learning, working and cultural lives. The Department’s research capacity is further enhanced through participation in the Institute of Coding (IoC), a national OfS initiative to address the UK’s digital skills gap, with 60+ universities and industry partners. The IoC synergistically supports our research and impact strategies through academic staff posts and targeted programme development (for example, through a collaborative PGCert with the British Library and National Archives). 1.2 Research strategy We develop our research and impact strategies in the context of two overarching aims: -  to be a world-leading research centre with complementary expertise in both theoretical and applied computer science;  -  driven by Birkbeck’s mission, to develop flexible opportunities in cutting-edge computer science for a diverse range of students, particularly working Londoners.  The latter provides unique opportunities to engage, through students bringing real-world problems driven by their work environment, with a range of IT companies and other Page 1  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) organisations. Review of REF2014 research strategy. As stated in our REF2014 environment narrative, we have “investigated fundamental research problems whose solution advances knowledge in the discipline, and undertaken collaborative research with partners from other disciplines that exploits and enhances our expertise” and have achieved significant advances in all the focus areas identified therein (see below). Post-REF2014 strategy. Our research strategy over the census period, and continuing into the next five years, is based on seven key principles: (R1) Recruit internationally excellent staff whose research enhances our strategic directions (detailed below). (R2) Foster an environment of inclusivity and equality, where all researchers can thrive and fulfil their potential. (R3) Promote research leadership, enabling collaboration and support within and across the research groups, including support for research career development. (R4) Maintain research excellence and innovation in core computer science, investigating fundamental problems in both theory and practice, spearheading the development of new technologies. (R5) Carry out world-leading interdisciplinary research, recognising that computer science is pervasive in all areas of society. (R6) Amplify the impact of our research through collaboration with organisations across the public, private and third sectors—nationally, internationally and across disciplines. (R7) Provide all researchers with the environment they need to pursue research in their chosen fields, including purpose-built labs, specialist hardware and software, and financial and technical support. Our research and impact strategies are articulated and regularly reviewed by the department’s Research Committee, which horizon scans to identify strategically significant emerging areas of research that dovetail with our existing profile. Its Chair is a member of the School Research Committee, which develops and shares best practice across BEI, monitors research student recruitment and progression, and works to enhance BEI’s research environment. The School Research Committee articulates with the College’s Research Committee and Research Strategy Group through its Chair, BEI’s Assistant Dean for Research (this was Poulovassilis till summer 2015 when she was appointed Deputy Dean for Research Enhancement, continuing as a BEI member of the College Research Committee). Strategic areas of research. Driven by principles (R1)-(R7), we made significant changes to our staffing and organisation of research since REF2014, reflecting our vision for this census period and beyond: First, we refocused the Computational Intelligence group into Experimental Data Science (EDS) and enhanced it with three new appointments, researching data-driven methods for cloud computing, bioinformatics and IoT security. In recognition of our emerging strength in Algorithms, Verification & Software (AVS), we created a new group in this area and further strengthened it by appointing two experts in automated program analysis/verification and algorithmic graph theory.  Page 2  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) The Information Management & Web Technologies group was refocused to Knowledge Representation & Data Management (KRDM) accompanied by three appointments: in database theory, constraint satisfaction and logic; in temporal representation and reasoning; and in graph data management. Finally, we launched BIDA and recruited its director, who also strengthens EDS research in experimental algorithmics and data analytics. KRDM strategy. KRDM addresses challenges arising from managing, accessing and exploiting heterogeneous high-volume data, with particular focus on logic-based approaches, database theory and related computational complexity problems, and graph data management. Since REF2014 we have published 70+ journal and 170+ conference papers, including in highly prestigious venues such as JACM (2 papers), AIJ(5), TOCL(4), LMCS(2), JAIR(2), PODS(5), ICDT(3), IJCAI(7), LICS(6). Ground-breaking advances have been made in first-order model checking in the context of database theory, logic and complexity (H.Chen); complexity and succinctness theory for ontologybased data access (OBDA); foundations of temporal OBDA; and game-theoretic characterisations of query inseparability and of the Horn fragments of description and first-order guarded logics (Kontchakov, Ryzhikov, Zakharyaschev). Fundamental advances have been made in flexible processing of graph queries (Cali, Poulovassilis, Wood); quality-driven data integration (Martin, Poulovassilis); designing the first logic-based language for JSON transformation and querying (Hidders); and axiomatising and classifying algebras of functions with composition and (anti)domain/range – an emergent tool in program verification (Mikulas). Over the next five years KRDM will focus on: -  fundamental problems in computer science logic, including database theory, constraint satisfaction, complexity of ontology-mediated query answering;  -  developing techniques for intelligent data access, integration and management, in collaboration with partners in industry;  -  contributing to new industry standards in graph data management.  AVS strategy. AVS addresses the efficiency of computation, including theory, design and implementation, with several foci: foundations of algorithms and computational complexity, algorithm design, and analysis and verification of systems and software. Since REF2014, we have published 65+ journal and 85+ conference papers, including in ACM TAGL (1 paper), JCSS(4), IEEE TSE(2), ACM TOCT(3), FOCS(3), SODA(1), STACS(2), ICALP(4), POPL(2), ICSE(2), LICS(2), IJCAR(3), TACAS(3), CONCUR(3). We do not shy away from notorious open problems, such as reconstructing graph properties from subsets of vertex-deleted subgraphs (Fenner); inference of worst-case runtime complexity bounds and size bounds for programs on integers; satisfiability for separation logic with inductive definitions (Fuhs); the Matroid variation of the famous Secretary Problem; and lower bounds for relaxed locally decodable codes (Lachish). Other ground-breaking advances have been made in propositional knowledge representation and order theory (Razgon); and algorithmic techniques for sparse graph classes (Reidl). Fundamental advances have been made in automated termination analysis of higher-order programs (Fuhs); theory and verification algorithms for fuzzy systems (Han); automated approaches to improve the quality of API documentation (T.Chen); and algorithmic approaches to learning neural architecture hyperparameters and ensembles (Magoulas). Over the next five years AVS will focus on: Page 3  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) -  computational complexity; randomised algorithms and their applications; theory and realworld applications of graph width measures and notions of structural sparseness;  -  verification techniques for emerging paradigms such as probabilistic, neural and quantum programming;  -  application of machine learning and NLP to software engineering problems such as program synthesis;  -  deep learning for modelling, classification, and autonomous control.  EDS strategy. EDS develops novel methods and systems for the computational analysis of data. A core ingredient is the exploitation of metadata, observations and measurements from large-scale information systems to ground testable theory, conduct experimentation and enable practical application of research outcomes, leading to demonstrable economic and societal impacts. Since REF2014, we have published 140+ journal and 120+ conference papers, including in TPAMI (9 papers), IEEE TKDE(2), IEEE TIFS(2), IEEE TSC(2), JoCCH(2), Scientometrics(2), JASIST(2), TACL(2), PLoS One(3). We have made significant advances in data analytics for Parkinson’s disease, deployed in clinical trials in the UK, USA, Germany and Belgium and released as open-source software (Roussos, Weston); named entity recognition and sentiment analysis (Levene, Weston, Zhang); resource usage optimisation and real-time anomaly detection (Sotiriadis); data-driven cyber security techniques, receiving a Samsung research award (Yoo); a Fisher-Rao metric for curves using edge information (Maybank); topological patterns of network evolution characteristic of trustworthy actors (Provetti); deep neural network techniques for predicting human protein function (Wan). Over the next five years EDS will focus on: – modelling social and human dynamics employing spatio-temporal probabilistic models; – disease progression assessment using mobile and wearable devices; – deep learning methods, with biomedical, cloud computing and security applications; – applications of NLP in sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and distributional representations of language. BIDA strategy. Through its network of collaborations and external partnerships, BIDA provides a vibrant environment for a next generation of data scientists. Collaborations are often conceived through BIDA’s regular workshops, convened to explore cross-disciplinary perspectives on specific topics and challenges. New collaborations have been forged with Geography and the British Geological Survey to develop computational models of coastal erosion using IoT smart sensor data; with the Institute of Criminal Policy Research (funded by the Dawes Trust) to investigate user signals in social media communications for evidencegathering in criminal prosecutions; and with a market branding company to develop an NLP system for matching journalistic articles and Twitter data. Over the next five years BIDA will: – develop data-driven methodologies to address big data and scalability challenges arising in the sciences; – collaborate with researchers in social sciences, arts and humanities to exploit the potential of advances in text mining, data curation and user modelling; Page 4  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) – spearhead public debate on ethics and emerging technologies such as video surveillance, user profiling and AI in general. BKL strategy. BKL research has focused on the challenges of designing software to support users’ knowledge creation processes. We have forged new collaborations with the British Library, British Museum, and educationalists from several European universities and secured joint funding leading to intelligent tools to support exploratory learning (EU), a specialist knowledge base to support museology scholars’ research (AHRC), and further development of the Samtla statistical language modelling software for searching digital archives (Wellcome Trust ISSF) – ranked second in the 2018 British Library Labs Competition. Over the next five years BKL will: – apply cutting-edge computer science to co-design tools that support domain experts in data integration, analysis and visualisation and in creating and sharing knowledge; – collaborate with educationalists, psychologists and practitioners to exploit the potential of AI in providing personalised support for learners and tutors in open-ended learning settings. 1.3 Impact strategy Review of REF2014 impact strategy. As stated in our REF2014 impact narrative, we have encouraged “collaborative research carried out by multidisciplinary teams involving user stakeholders” (cf. Impact Case Roussos-LondonAmbulance), promoted “links with industry partners with whom we can develop research exploitation routes” (cf. Case Study Kontchakov-VKG), engaged “with commercial, educational and policy organisations in knowledge transfer activities” (cf. Case Study Roussos-ITU), and maintained “departmentindustry networks through our part-time postgraduates and alumni”. Post-REF2014 strategy. Following REF2014, the Department reassessed its approach to generating impact and put in place additional initiatives and structures to enhance it. Our approach is based on five key principles, which will continue to drive our strategy over the next five years: (I1) Embed impact within our strategic research directions and research processes. For example, EDS employs an experimental systems approach leading to the development of novel software in healthcare and smart cities (cf. Case Studies Roussos-LondonAmbulance, Roussos-ITU). KRDM develops data management theories and technologies working with end-users in industry (cf. Case Study Kontchakov-VKG). (I2) Develop impact-generating activities through interdisciplinary and industrial collaborations (see Sec. 4). (I3) Recognise the importance of impact in our recruitment strategy by hiring staff with world-leading research developed collaboratively with industrial users. (I4) Leverage our unique relationship with research students: due to Birkbeck’s distinctive mission, we are uniquely positioned to collaboratively address economic and societal challenges identified by our students, the majority of whom pursue research concurrently with their 
professional careers. For example, our work on intelligent tools for ambulance routing (Case Study RoussosLondonAmbulance) drew on the experience of part-time PhD student Marcus Poulton at the London Ambulance Service; and our collaboration with Neo4j on advanced querying Page 5  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) methods for graph databases was facilitated by Petra Selmer, who completed her PhD part-time at Birkbeck while working for Neo4j. (I5) Communicate the outcomes of our research through a full breadth of non-academic routes, both digital and in-person. These initiatives are supported by structures and measures including: –  Department’s Academic Lead for Impact, who promotes and monitors the implementation of impact strategy and achievement of impact, and ensures that impacts are recorded and communicated, building a knowledge base of external stakeholders and partners to inform future planning.  –  Department’s Industry Advisory Board (IAB), comprising senior IT professionals from UK/global corporations in sectors such as innovation, consultancy, web/mobile technologies, ed-tech, energy, telecommunications. IAB members advise on all aspects of research to ensure relevance to economic and societal challenges, and serve as mentors supporting the development of collaborative activities as per (I2).  –  School’s Research Impact Officer (RIO), a full-time role in BEI with the remit of evaluating and enhancing impact, working closely with other professional staff of the School and College (public engagement, research development and support, alumni, business services, communications). When new staff join the Department they meet with the RIO to discuss the impact potential of their research. Staff preparing research funding proposals consult with the RIO to ensure that impact is fully developed and embedded. The RIO meets regularly with the department’s Academic Lead for Impact and the RIOs of other Schools, allowing us to benefit from and inform best practice and wider impact strategy across the College.  –  School and College Impact funding, available to amplify the impact of ongoing research (see 3.1).  Areas of impact. Following this approach, we have substantially increased our impact on the IT, healthcare, culture and urban development sectors, as well as now impacting on digital humanities, cyber security and linked data management (see 4.2). 1.4 Research integrity and open research environment. The Department is committed to professionalism, openness, exercise of independent thought and application of ethical principles, aligning with Birkbeck’s Research Integrity and Open Research Data policies and concordats. BIDA leads Birkbeck’s research on ethical issues in emerging technologies, and is the public face of the College in the debate on the deployment of AI in our societies. All staff and research students undertake mandatory ethics training before commencing their research at Birkbeck. We operate a rigorous process for reviewing the ethical aspects of research involving human participants, proposed by staff or students. The review is coordinated by the Department’s Research Ethics Officer (REO) who passes non-routine cases to the School or College Ethics Committee. The REO works with researchers to incorporate additional safeguards if required. The REO serves on the School Ethics Committee, which has oversight of all ethical reviews in the School and runs regular workshops to ensure that researchers are fully apprised of the College’s principles and policies on research ethics and research integrity. Departmental REOs undertake mandatory training before being appointed. Our department’s PhD students played an active role in organising the Bloomsbury colleges’ “Love Data Week” for research students in 2018 and 2020, discussing research data Page 6  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) management and ethics. Wherever possible we encourage staff to publish open-access, if necessary supplementing funding available for this from the College. All articles accepted for publication are deposited in open access form (Green or Gold) in the Birkbeck institutional repository BIROn. We extensively use open publishing services such as arXiv (260+ papers since REF2014). We use github, dedicated Web pages and the Birkbeck Data Repository BiRD to make all software and data produced by our research freely available, compliant with regulatory frameworks and data protection legislation. For example, the code for the Virtual Knowledge Graph system Ontop is available at https://github.com/ontop/ontop and for the Parkinson’s PDkit at https://github.com/pdkit/pdkit, the ontology developed by the Weaving Communities of Practice project at https://www2.bbk.ac.uk/weavingcommunities/Ontology/, the Mapping Museums data and software at http://museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/data and https://github.com/MappingMuseums/MMWebApp. 2. People 2.1 Staffing Strategy and Staff Development Mentoring, Probation, Appraisal. Academic and research staff are assigned to one of the research Groups as their primary affiliation, providing peer support alongside a research Mentor who advises on research career development, training, funding applications and forging collaborations with other institutions/disciplines. Staff meet as required, but at least annually, with their Mentor. Probationary staff meet annually with their Probationary Advisor to review all aspects of their work. Post-probation academic staff undertake an annual Academic Review with a senior colleague appointed by the HoD (Levene) to discuss achievements in the previous year, objectives for the coming year, career aspirations, promotion planning, balance of work, and any obstacles to progress in research, teaching or academic management. Research staff undertake a similar review, tailored towards their career stage. Training. The Department’s staff undertake College training in diversity and equality, unconscious bias, recruitment, line management, research supervision (for both new and experienced supervisors), promotion, data protection, writing grant proposals, project management, open access, public engagement and knowledge exchange, aligned with the relevant policies and concordats. This provides a structure supporting the more informal coaching through mentorship within the Department. Staff undertake training organised by the School in publishing research, generating impact, research integrity and ethics, using audio-visual media for research communication (supported by the BEI Film Unit and the Derek Jarman Lab), and applying for research funding – including events where senior officers from specific funding bodies are invited to speak directly to staff. The Department’s Knowledge Exchange champion organises regular training in commercialisation, delivered by external experts. New staff attend innovation and entrepreneurship training delivered by UCL Enterprise. Workload allocation. Academic staff have a standard annual teaching load determining the amount of lecture/lab-based teaching, tutoring and BSc/MSc project supervision. Allocation of teaching duties is undertaken by the HoD in discussion with the individuals and the Directors of Studies. Management duties are also shared evenly, fostering academics’ engagement in College, School and Departmental processes. Most are rotated every three years and, as with teaching, individuals discuss their preferences with the HoD. There are reductions for ECRs (see below). Page 7  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) To promote transparency, everyone’s duties are published annually on the departmental intranet. Research Grants, Impact. The School’s Research Development Officer assists staff in developing new research collaborations and proposals, and oversees a formal peer review process for all funding proposals. The School’s Research Impact Officer assists staff in developing impact from their research (see 1.3). The Department’s academic lead for impact (Zakharyaschev) and Knowledge Exchange champion (Roussos) work with individuals and the Research and Impact Officers, articulating with the School’s and College’s training and support mechanisms. The College’s Research Office provides support for submitting proposals and communicating with external funders. It advises on IP protection and exploitation, supported with specialist Tech Transfer expertise from UCL Business. The School provides funding for pump-priming the research of new staff and new collaborations (School Research Fund) and for supporting staff in developing impact from their research (School Impact Fund). Applications can be made several times each year and are assessed according to quality and strategic importance by the School’s Executive Board. Academic staff can additionally apply to College funding calls e.g. College Impact Seed Fund, Wellcome Trust ISSF. Sabbaticals. Academic staff (including fixed- and part-time) can take one term in ten as a Research or Impact sabbatical. They are required to report back on how they have used this leave and the outcomes achieved. ECRs. The teaching duties of ECRs are kept below the departmental average, starting at a half load and increasing gradually to a full load by the third year. ECRs have a lighter management load throughout their first three years, taking on roles with coordination and decision-making responsibilities appropriate for their career stage. Research Mentors, the Director of Research and HoD provide guidance on all aspects of research. The effectiveness of our support of ECRs is evidenced by the promotion during this census period of seven lecturers to SL and two to Reader. PDRAs contribute to the Department’s vitality through activities such as helping to organise conferences/workshops/seminars, running stakeholder events, producing research software/datasets, preparing online research-related content, presenting at conferences, and undertaking research-related visits. They are offered opportunities to guest lecture on taught modules, supported by their line manager and the Department’s Teaching Tutor. The effectiveness of our support for PDRAs is exemplified by the career trajectories of two colleagues who joined as PDRAs and were then successful in being appointed to a Lectureship, with subsequent promotion of one to SL and one to Reader. Three other PDRAs have progressed to Lecturer/SL positions at other HEIs during this census period; four have progressed to senior R&D posts in industry. Staffing and recruitment. The College’s recruitment strategy focusses on appointing mainly at Lecturer level. The new academics we appointed since REF2014 (see below) are demonstrably meeting our research and impact strategy principles R1, R4, R6, I1-I3, as evidenced by their research expertise, publications quality, extensive collaborations and impact. Most academic posts are open-ended although on occasion there are fixed-term posts associated with specific initiatives; to date, all our fixed-term post-holders have been transferred to open-ended contracts towards the end of probation. Since REF2014 we have appointed 8 Lecturers (4 early-career), one SL, one Reader (four Page 8  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) are BAME, all are male, women were shortlisted for seven of the posts). The Department grew by 30% over this census period and now comprises 8 Professors, 3 Readers, 7 SLs and 8 Lecturers, showing an even balance between senior and junior grades. In recognition of the strength of our strategy, the College has announced three more posts for 2021: one Professor, two SL/Readers. We are actively addressing gender imbalance through the measures outlined in 2.3. A steady rate of staff promotions facilitates succession planning as more senior management roles (including research leadership roles) can be prepared for through discussions, facilitated by the HoD, between current holders and staff seeking promotion, and handed over after promotion. Female staff benefit from the College’s Aurora Leadership programme. Space. The Department works with College Estates to provision high-quality premises for researchers. Full-time academics are allocated their own office. Part-time academics, research staff, and full-time research students are assigned their own desk and PC in a shared office/lab. Part-time research students are assigned a shared desk and PC. There are three dedicated Research Seminar and Meeting rooms, and additional ones bookable throughout the School. The department’s labs have ample capacity to be booked for user design/evaluation workshops and community engagement/dissemination events. Additional study and social space is available in the BEI Graduate Centre. Recognition of research and impact. Appointment, promotion and remuneration processes recognise all aspects of research, including outputs, grants, supervision, public engagement, knowledge exchange, impact, community service. To reward successful grant applications, a small proportion of the grant overheads allocated to the Department is available to the award holder(s) to fund research-related expenses. Research achievements are publicised on the Department’s website, ensuring visibility, providing inspiration for early-career researchers, and creating a benchmark for expected levels of activity. Research Exchanges. The Department provides generous financial support for conference attendance and research-related visits: see 3.1,4.1. Retention. We have high academic staff retention, with just three leavers in this census period. Implementation of the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. As detailed above and in 2.2 and 2.3, we espouse the three Principles of the 2019 Concordat by providing a supportive and inclusive working environment, recognising and valuing all researchers’ contributions, and fostering researchers’ professional and career development. Our provisions are under continual review by the Department’s management and research committees. 2.2 Research Students Recruitment. The Department’s research student recruitment strategy leverages our research reputation to attract strong applicants. Aligning with Birkbeck’s mission, the majority enrol for part-time study and have significant other commitments. Student recruitment levels rose in the latter part of the previous census period and have been maintained throughout this period, with 45 students enrolled during 2019/20 (62% PT, 38% FT). We recruit applicants from diverse backgrounds, as evidenced by our current research student demographics: 40% BAME, 40% non-British, 25% female, 12% registered disabled. Staff involved in research student recruitment are required to have undertaken recruitment training. Research Studentships. The Department has funded 14 PhD studentships in this census period, awarded to exceptional part-time or full-time applicants. Additionally, 2 students have Page 9  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) been funded by College interdisciplinary studentships, awarded from time to time through institution-wide competition. Birkbeck staff can also apply for collaborative PhD studentships in the annual Bloomsbury Consortium PhD Studentships competition: we have been successful in 4 such bids in this period, two in collaboration with UCL IoE and two with LSHTM. The Department also has 4 Graduate Teaching Assistant posts whose holders complete a PhD over four years, with full fee remission, while contributing to the department’s teaching and enhancing their transferable skills. Support and Monitoring. We implement, and in some areas go beyond, the College’s Code of Practice for Postgraduate Training and Research. Each student is assigned one or two primary supervisors with expertise in their research area, and a secondary supervisor for a broader perspective. Less experienced supervisors are teamed with staff who have strong supervisory track records. Female students may request that one of their supervisors is female. Full-time students meet weekly with their supervisors, part-time students every fortnight. The Research Tutor oversees students’ well-being, induction and training, organises termly meetings with all students and an annual survey. Three seminar series, specialist discussion/reading groups, research group/centre meetings and annual Research Days provide 
students with a range of opportunities to integrate into the research life of the department and present their work in informal settings. We make special efforts to create opportunities for part-time students to meet with staff and other students. All training events for research students are held in late afternoon/evening. A subcommittee of the Department’s Research Committee monitors students’ progression, training needs, transfer to PhD, and completion. Students submit written reports annually and give oral presentations at key stages. There has been a 10% increase in the number of PhDs awarded in this census period compared to the last. In the Department’s last research student survey, 90% stated they were satisfied with their supervision and 88% with the progression processes. Skills Development. All students attend the Department’s Research Methods training and generic skills training organised by Birkbeck’s Graduate Research School and the Bloomsbury Postgraduate Skills Network. Most College training courses for staff are also open to research students. The Department funds students’ presentation of papers at conferences – at least one paper per year, for both PT and FT students. Research students are offered opportunities to provide teaching assistance on our taught programmes and receive training for this organised by the College and support from the Teaching Tutor. The effectiveness of our research student support and training is evidenced by the career trajectories of our PhD graduates, e.g. in this census period five attained Lecturer positions at HEIs, two exploited their doctoral research to co-found new start-ups, and four were appointed to R&D posts in areas such as medical informatics, data science and software services. 2.3 Equality and Diversity Strategy to support equality and diversity For all posts we encourage applicants with diverse backgrounds, as evidenced by our current staff demographics: 6 academic/research staff are BAME, the majority are of non-British origin, two are women. For new female academic/research staff, we ensure that at least one of their Probationary Advisor or Mentor is a woman. Page 10  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) All categories of staff are required to undertake Equality & Diversity and Unconscious Bias training, and to repeat this every three years. Staff involved in recruitment are required to have undertaken recruitment training, which includes an equalities component. Staff recruitment panels contain at least one woman. The HoD supports staff preparing to apply for promotion, accelerated increments and performance-related payments, which are open to all staff categories. Staff are also encouraged to attend the College’s workshops on applying for promotion. A positive review of promotions is undertaken annually by a panel comprising the HoD and senior professors (4 men,1 woman) to identify staff to encourage to apply. Mentors and academic reviewers also play a proactive role in this respect. The Department engages with the College’s and School’s equality and diversity initiatives and with the Action Plan of the HR Excellence in Research Award, working with the School’s Assistant Dean for Equality & Diversity to embed these in all its processes. We have a staunch commitment to Athena SWAN: Poulovassilis was a member of the College’s Athena SWAN Committee from its inception till 2017 and participated in the successful application for Bronze in 2016. Roussos led the Department’s Athena SWAN Self-Assessment Team preparing the successful application for Bronze in 2017. Poulovassilis is a Mentor in the Aurora Leadership Programme. Our annual Andrew & Kathleen Booth lecture attracts leading innovators and alternates a female and male distinguished speaker each year. The Department’s staffing capacity enables sabbatical leave to be accommodated as part of normal workload planning. All staff categories are entitled to parental/caring leave according to College policies, and their duties are covered by recruiting additional staff for a fixed period. Due in part to Birkbeck’s teaching being largely in the evening, the Department has a longstanding culture where flexible working is the norm for all staff. Options include homeworking, staggered hours/flexi-time, part-time and job-share. Evening teaching for academic staff does not exceed 3 evenings per week and is balanced by late morning starts. Remote working (including remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic) is enabled by extensive IT infrastructure allowing remote access to all resources. Staff and students are also supported through licensing software and loaning hardware for home use. In the last Departmental survey, 96% and 88% of staff endorsed the Department’s flexible working and family support, respectively. In the last College survey, 89% of the Department’s staff agreed that they work in an inclusive and enabling environment promoting tolerance and freedom from discrimination. Career pathways. Part-time staff have the same opportunities and entitlements as full-time, with pro-rata allocation of work duties. Fixed-term staff have the same opportunities and entitlements as those on open-ended contracts. Announcements of job openings are regularly emailed by HR. PDRAs approaching the end of their contract meet with their line manager to discuss continuing work opportunities. Bridging funding is available for PDRAs between contracts. Research Leadership roles. The Director of Research (Zakharyaschev), Director of BIDA (Provetti) and Director of BKL (Poulovassilis) are appointed by the HoD in consultation with the Dean and senior staff. Research Group directors are appointed by the HoD in consultation with the Director of Research and Group members. The departmental Research Committee is chaired by the Director of Research. Its core members include the Research Tutor, Group and Centre directors, and elected representatives of the research staff and students. However, all  Page 11  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) are encouraged to attend its meetings and participate in the formulation of research and impact strategy, and the setting and monitoring of objectives. Access to funding. All academic and research staff and students can apply to the Department for funding to attend conferences, undertake research-related visits, attend training courses, and organise stakeholder workshops and dissemination events. All staff have access to the same support mechanisms in preparing applications for School, College and external funding (see 2.1). Returning from leave and changing circumstances. Our flexible working provisions enable staff to manage transitions after returning from periods of parental leave or ill health, changes in their health or caring responsibilities, and switching between full- and part-time working. Staff returning from leave may request flexible working or a variation in their contract (including homeworking, staggered hours/flexi-time, part-time, job-share). Changes to working arrangements are managed flexibly between the individual and their line manager. Research students can similarly switch between full- and part-time study and can request breaks-in-study to accommodate changes in their professional or personal circumstances. Routine planning for periods of maternity, paternity, shared parental and adoption leave includes a detailed leave planner and planning for Keeping in Touch (KIT) days. Staff on maternity/adoption leave can take up to ten paid KIT days. Upon return to work, staff are supported with childcare costs through Birkbeck’s childcare vouchers scheme. Returning staff and students have access to the College’s nursery, which operates 5.30-9pm when most teaching and supervision takes place. Support for those with disabilities. The Department’s Disability Officer liaises with the College’s Disability support services to ensure that support plans are collaboratively formulated with staff and students to enable them to work and study effectively. This includes access to disability allowances and learning support funds, provisioning of assistive technologies, and adjustments to working environments, work duties and required presence in College. The Disability Officer is a member of the School’s Disability Working Group. Wellbeing of staff and students. The HoD operates an open-door policy as do all academic and professional staff (virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic). The Department has a code of practice governing responsiveness to emails and requests for meetings. So staff and students are easily able to obtain advice on College, School and Departmental policies, support mechanisms and resources. We place strong emphasis on integration and communication across the department. This is ensured through regular research group/centre meetings, three seminar series, training events for staff and students, and a monthly departmental “Merienda” where we celebrate the past month’s achievements. There are two annual social events, the Christmas party and the Away Day in September. In the last College survey, 88% of the Department’s staff agreed that Birkbeck is a good place to work. Consideration of Equality and Diversity in construction of REF submission. Our departmental REF preparation team (3 men, 1 woman) read and recommended outputs and impact case studies for our UoA. The selection of outputs and impact case studies was undertaken by a School-level panel chaired by the Dean and including the School’s three UoA leads, Deputy Dean, Assistant Dean for Research and one external expert (5 men, 2 women). The College’s code of practice was followed throughout, including a three-round process for outputs selection. After each round the College undertook an analysis of the distribution of outputs across staff with respect to multiple protected characteristics and no statistically significant imbalances were found for our UoA. Page 12  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) 3. Income, infrastructure and facilities Our 30% growth in staff since REF2014 has been accompanied by a strategic aim to increase research resources in terms of income (both external and internal), office and lab space, and high-performance computing. It is to be noted that we undertake significant amounts of fundamental research for which additional external funding is not required. 3.1 Research funding The Department has three main sources of income to support its research strategy: (i) external funding from research councils, foundations and trusts; (ii) internal funding from the School and College; (iii) OfS through our IoC participation. External grants. External awards have grown by 50% from £1.6M in the previous REF period to £2.4M in the current period. Major awards include: –  KRDM: the EPSRC LIQUID grant on data integration (£89K) and the EPSRC iTract and quadMD grants on OBDA (£354K, £453K), leading to impact case study Kontchakov-VKG and major publications in JACM, AIJ, JAIR, LICS, PODS;  –  EDS: an M.J.Fox Foundation grant to develop a data science toolbox for Parkinson’s disease (£114K), an Innovate UK grant to develop the cloudUPDRS app for Parkinson’s sufferers (£69K), and funding from the Bloomsbury Consortium and Wellcome Trust ISSF to investigate the IoT’s role in giving agency and voice to individuals and communities (£78K); leading also to publications in IEEE Access, J. Ambient Intelligence & Smart Environments, J. Pervasive Mobile Computing, PerCom, eHealth 360o ;  –  AVS: three EPSRC grants on risk measurement (£101K), probabilistic verification (£100K), and stability in graphs (£152K), leading to publications in TCS, IJAR, J. Comb., J. Comb. Theory, POPL;  –  BIDA: UKRI GCRF Action Against Stunting Hub funding (£195K), developing data analysis techniques to investigate the causes of child stunting (still in early stages);  –  BKL: EU iTalk2Learn project (£326K) on intelligent support for 5-11 year olds’ learning of maths, and AHRC Mapping Museums project (£215K) developing a specialist knowledge base for museology scholars and professionals; leading also to publications in ACM JoCCH, UMAP, EC-TEL, LAK.  Internal grants. In this census period we were awarded School funding of £110K for pumppriming research projects, £83K for impact development (impact case studies RoussosLondonAmbulance and Roussos-ITU were supported by a series of such grants), £30K for conference attendance, as well as £50K from the College’s ISSF, Impact Seed Fund and NYU Collaboration Fund. The Department additionally provided £102K to staff and students attending conferences and undertaking research-related visits. Thus, internal research funding amounts to over £375K. IoC grants. The IoC awarded us over £600K to develop new UG/PG programmes in Data Science. This was a significant boost to our Data Science and Algorithms research as it funded 50% of three new academic posts. A PGCert was developed with the British Library and National Archives to provide digital skills training for their staff, building on and extending our research collaborations in the Samtla project. We secured additional OfS funding of £100K to develop a new PGCert in Applied Data Science, funding 50% of a further post. The IoC funds also Birkbeck’s IoC Manager who contributes to Samtla and NLP research at the BKL. IoC membership also enhances our environment through initiatives to widen participation in underPage 13  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) represented groups; for example, we were awarded £120K in scholarships funding for women and black students on the new PGCert. Future funding. Continuing to increase external funding, from a broad range of sources, is a key aim. We are currently preparing 7 proposals for EPSRC funding, 2 BBSRC/MRC proposals in life sciences informatics, 2 AHRC/ESRC proposals in digital humanities and museum data analytics, and 4 InnovateUK proposals in healthcare data analytics, blockchain analytics, construction sensor data analysis, and computational journalism. Two proposals (EPSRC, AHRC, £500K) have already been funded in 2021. 3.2 Research infrastructure The Department works with the College’s Estates, ITS and Library to ensure provision of highquality space, general IT and learning resources for its researchers. BIDA’s foundation was in part a response to the REF2014 outcomes which recommended that the College invest more in interdisciplinary research and the research environment. BIDA is physically distributed across labs/offices of the participating Schools. Due to its research reach and the strategic significance it has established, the College is currently elevating BIDA to become one of Birkbeck’s eight Research Institutes, which will lead to increased college funding, support, and collaboration opportunities. Since its launch in 2016, BKL has been housed in a purpose-built lab for 20+ researchers and its membership has expanded to include researchers from Birkbeck’s departments of Psychology, History of Art and Cultures & Languages. Computing facilities. The Department provides the hardware, software and technical training required by all staff and students to undertake their research. In addition to equipment purchased for specific projects, we have a SLURM GPU cluster with 12xP100 and 16xGTX1080i GPUs. Virtual machines for R&D are provisioned on our Xen hypervisor pool (16 servers, 480 physical cores, 2.8TB RAM). We also have a Rocks cluster of six compute nodes and two further general-purpose computing servers (AMD EPYC). For storage we use two Read Intensive RAID arrays (2x9TB PCIe SSD) and a dedicated storage server (Open-E DSS) with 22TB SSD disk. Inter-host networks are 10Gbps or faster. Our teaching labs can be booked for user and community engagement events; when they are not in use we re-utilise the machines for research as a HTCondor pool with 1248 compute slots and 2TB RAM. Since REF2014 we have doubled our average spend on research computing to £40K per annum. Research Support Staff. The department’s research is supported by two Systems and one Administrative staff FTEs. In addition, three School staff FTEs – the Research Development, Impact, and Finance Officers – manage the School’s research processes and support departments’ research development and exploitation. The School’s Communication Officer and Event Officer 
support our research communication activities. Additional expertise and support is provided by the Department’s academic lead for impact and Knowledge Exchange champion, the Research Office, and UCL Business (see 2.1). 4. Collaboration and contribution to the research base, economy and society To achieve our strategic aims we collaborate with leading computer scientists, researchers from other disciplines, and user stakeholders beyond academia. In particular, we –  promote collaboration by inviting leading researchers to visit Birkbeck and supporting visits in the other direction;  Page 14  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) –  encourage and support staff in initiating joint projects with other university and industrial partners, including multi- and interdisciplinary research;  –  promote knowledge exchange, public engagement and impact by organising stakeholder workshops and dissemination events.  4.1 Research collaboration The Department runs weekly seminars where leading scholars from the UK, Europe and beyond present their research to staff and students. Approximately 100 seminars took place over this census period, often combined with additional activities within specific research groups. BIDA and BKL run additional interdisciplinary seminar series, with approximately 50 events during this period. 50+ researchers visited us during this period from universities in 18 countries, while staff undertook 100+ visits to universities/organisations in 21 countries. The Department contributed to funding longer-term visits of 20+ researchers from other universities/organisations to Birkbeck and 35+ such visits in the opposite direction. We have held Visiting Professorships at the Northwestern Polytechnical University, China, and University of Technology, Australia (Maybank); Bar-Ilan University (Levene); KAIST and University of Sydney (Yoo); Higher School of Economics, Russia (Zakharyaschev). Zhang is currently on a two-year leave of absence as Staff Research Scientist at Blue Prism AI Labs exploiting his expertise in machine learning. Articles published since 2014 have co-authors from 80+ universities in 30+ countries, making our research truly international. We have co-authors from 35+ companies including Alibaba, BNY Mellon, BT, IBM, Microsoft, Neo4j, Paddy Power, Samsung, Siemens, Telefonica Digital. Most of our funded research projects are in collaboration with colleagues from other universities in the UK and internationally, many from other disciplines, and with other stakeholders. For example, –  in KRDM, the OBDA projects are joint with the universities of Liverpool, Bozen-Bolzano and Sassari, and with Siemens (Germany), Sirius (Norway), Siris Academic (Spain), and the Pilsudski Institute of America;  –  in EDS, one project is collaborative with University of the Arts, Proboscis and British Antarctic Survey; another is with UCL IoN, Benchmark Performance, Retechnica and Audience Focus;  –  in BIDA, the new £19.76M UKRI GCRF project involves researchers from multiple science and social science disciplines affiliated with 18 institutions in the UK, India, Indonesia and Senegal;  –  in BKL, the Mapping Museums project is collaborative with Birkbeck’s History of Art department and stakeholders from across the UK museum sector (including Arts Council England, DCMS and the Museums Development Network); the Samtla project with the British Library, Wellcome Trust, and SOAS; and the iTalk2Learn project with educationalists from several European universities.  We frequently supervise students jointly with other departments and Bloomsbury Consortium Institutions: in this census period two students with Psychology (one MRC-funded, one Collegefunded), a College-funded student with Biology, and four Bloomsbury Consortium-funded students – two with UCL IoE, two with LSHTM.  Page 15  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) In addition to BIDA and BKL, staff are members of several other research centres, including the Centre for Cognition, Computation & Modelling, Centre for Innovation Management Research, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, and Centre for Educational Neuroscience. 4.2 Impact beyond academia Through implementation of our post-REF2014 impact strategy, our network of research users and beneficiaries has expanded substantially during the census period: –  In Healthcare, EDS has pioneered research into data-driven techniques to reduce ambulance arrival times, incorporated into decision support tools deployed by the London Ambulance Service (Impact Case Study Roussos-LondonAmbulance). In collaboration with clinical and commercial partners, we developed cloudUPDRS, the first smartphone app certified as a Class I medical device by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency for assessing the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. We are developing a secure platform for healthcare data analytics with Cambridge Medical Academy.  –  In Information technology, KRDM has made significant contributions to the development of theory, practice and tools for OBDA, collaborating in the development of the Ontop platform with start-up Ontopic (Italy) and other partners as listed in 4.1 (Impact Case Study Kontchakov-VKG). We have secured funding from the European Space Agency to develop conceptual modelling-based techniques for data exchange between ESA and their suppliers of satellite and rocket technology.  –  In Smart cities, Roussos is Associate Rapporteur of Study Group 20 of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), developing standards in service interoperability and big data analytics for smart cities. He has led research into integrating diverse technologies into a comprehensive system of smart city universal entity identification, ratified as ITU Recommendation Y.4805 and providing a blueprint for smart cities in China and several African countries (Impact Case Study Roussos-ITU).  –  In Cyber security, we have developed a data-driven cyber-intrusion detection platform in collaboration with KAIST, used at Samsung and BT. We are working with Samsung on next-generation monitoring and protection systems for IoT-enabled devices, and with a market-leading blockchain technology company on identifying abnormalities in blockchain data.  –  In Linked Data standardisation, Hidders co-leads the Property-Graph Schema Working Group of the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC). He is coordinating researchers and companies such as Neo4j, Amazon Neptune and Google to standardise the Property-Graph data model as LDBC’s representative on the international SQL Standard committee (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG3). The PGSWG is developing the GQL query language for graph data, to be incorporated also into SQL.  –  In Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage, the Samtla software has been deployed over the British Library historical text archive and Wellcome Trust Medical Library. UK museum organisations are using the Mapping Museums knowledge base to understand the current state of the sector. We are working with leading science museums including the Science Museum, London, and the Exploratorium, San Francisco, to develop audience research methods incorporating high-precision indoor location sensing and spatial analytics.  Page 16  Unit-level environment template (REF5b) As shown by the above, our research focuses on timely technological and societal problems. Most recently, the Covid-19 emergency led several staff to initiate projects aimed at understanding and mitigating the effects of the pandemic: Poulovassilis obtained collaborative funding with History of Art and Geography from the UKRI Covid-19 Rapid Response Call to investigate the resilience of UK museums during the crisis; Levene and Weston are collaborating with doctors from two London hospitals to develop a machine learning model for diagnosing Covid-19 from patients’ medical social media posts; Provetti is collaborating with Philosophy to explore privacy issues arising from Covid-tracking apps. 4.3 Wider influence We have served on the Editorial Boards of 30+ journals, including Artificial Intelligence, ACM ToCL, J.
